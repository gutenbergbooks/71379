</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">From</span> the city of Algiers,
looking eastwards across the bay, is seen a snow-covered mass
towering above lower ranges of mountains. It is to the country
lying immediately beneath those snow-clad peaks, inhabited by a
people of entirely different race and speech to the Arabs, and
known as Kabyles, that the following pages relate. Though Algiers
has many English visitors, this district remains little known; the
reason perhaps being the want of those accommodations that tourists
look for.</p>

<p>A day spent at Fort National, which is at the threshold of the
region I refer to, is usually considered ample, and exhausts their
interest. But any one making a more prolonged stay in a country, is
apt to look upon it in a different light to the passing traveller;
and I may be pardoned for having taken up the pen, if I should
succeed in inspiring the reader with some of the interest that I
feel for this district and its native inhabitants.</p>

<p>In former days, when the Kabyles were self-governing, immemorial
custom, religion, and tribal laws, rigidly enforced hospitality.
Special funds were put aside by the Jemāa, or village
Commune,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> for the
entertainment of travellers; it held itself responsible for the
safety of the stranger and for that of his luggage, and each
householder was in his turn called upon to play the part of
host.</p>

<p>At present, under French rule, it is obligatory for the Amine,
or headman, to entertain a stranger for one night. If it were not
for this law, it is clear that, as there are no inns, a European
journeying through the country might, by the caprice of the
natives, be forced to pass the night without shelter on the
mountain side.</p>

<p>The Amine refuses the money offered him in requital, but some
one can always be found to accept a suitable payment.</p>

<p>The house where the traveller may be entertained, will probably
be constructed in somewhat the following fashion.</p>

<p>A series of rooms is built round an open courtyard, which has a
single entrance, and within which cattle, sheep, and goats are
driven for protection at night. The building is of blocks of stone
roughly plastered together, and whitewashed over. The beams and
rafters of the roof are apparent, and upon them is spread a thick
layer of canes, the crannies between being filled up with earth;
above is a covering of tiles, and on these again heavy stones help
by their weight to keep the whole in its place. The eaves are
broad, and sometimes project so far over the courtyard that they
are supported by wooden columns, and thus form a rude corridor,
which affords shelter for the beasts from the weather.</p>

<p>Is not such a courtyard the model of the rude ancestor of such
refined examples as are to be seen at Pompeii, where the
open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> enclosure for
the protection of animals has grown into a fountain-refreshed
garden, and the rustic corridor into one decorated with elegant
encaustic paintings?</p>

<p>In some parts of the country, large flattened slabs of cork are
substituted for tiles, and are laid overlapping in the manner of
slates; a layer of earth is beaten down on the top, which soon
becomes overgrown with moss and weeds. These roofs are much flatter
than the tiled ones, being just sufficiently inclined to throw off
water when it rains heavily; they thus form terraces useful for
various purposes, such as drying fruit. The rooms are lighted
chiefly from their doorways, which lead from the courtyard, but in
the outer walls are a few windows just large enough to permit a
person’s head being protruded. Rooms are set apart for the women
and children of the household, and on one side of the courtyard is
the guest chamber. On entering this, the stranger is struck by
finding it resemble a barn, rather than an ordinary room at an inn.
The roof is supported by columns and beams, made from the roughly
trimmed trunks of trees, and the floor is of beaten plaster. At one
end of the room is a wall about five feet in height, supporting a
broad platform or stage, on which are placed gigantic earthenware
jars, square in plan, and five or six feet in height. These contain
a provision of dried figs and grain, which is thus secured from
damp and the attacks of rats. The platform is the roof of a stable
for the accommodation of mules and cows. The room has only
one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span> door, which
serves also as a passage to this stable. The beasts entering, turn,
and are driven down an inclined plane, which opens between the
outer wall of the building and the wall supporting the platform,
and find themselves in their stalls. The floor of the stable is
three or four feet lower than where the guest reclines, who is
startled at seeing the heads of the beasts appear at large square
openings, on a level with, and facing him.</p>

<p>This singular arrangement has at any rate the merit of allowing
the traveller to observe whether his animals are properly cared
for, since literally they sup at the sideboard.</p>

<p>Thoughts also are likely to arise concerning the Nativity, and
how the infant Saviour was laid in his swaddling-clothes in a
manger; for here is an example, that the most natural course to
adopt, supposing that there should be an extra number of guests,
would be to enter the stable under the same roof.</p>

<p>In one corner is a small hole made in the floor, where live
embers are placed if the weather be cold, the smoke finding its
exit as best it can through a hole above. Rugs are spread on the
floor, and in due time the evening meal is brought, which will
include a Kouskous, the characteristic dish of the country,
answering to the macaroni of Southern Italy.</p>

<p>The Amine and some of his friends, sit by while the guest eats;
but they do not partake themselves, their <i>rôle</i> is, to
enliven the stranger with their conversation, to serve him, and to
encourage him to eat as much as he can. When he has finished they
retire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span> leaving a
guardian who sleeps just within the threshold. The traveller rolls
himself up in his wraps, and disposes himself to sleep upon the
floor. Even if tired, he is fortunate if he wake refreshed in the
morning, for sometimes there may be other animals besides cows and
mules—rats in the roof or about the bins, not to mention fleas, the
dogs of the house bark, and jackals howl outside.</p>

<p>Such being a picture of the native accommodation, it is evident
that a European proposing to remain in the country, away from
French settlements, must travel with a tent. The opportunity to do
so, was offered me by Colonel Playfair, Her Majesty’s
Consul-General at Algiers, who most kindly placed his fine tent at
my disposal; and I take this occasion to again thank him for the
shelter under which I spent so many pleasant days and peaceful
nights.</p>

<p>I have been asked, ‘What do you find attractive in this
semi-barbarous Kabylia?’ Before relating my story, it will not be
out of place to mention a few facts relating to the country, which
in my estimation render it interesting for an artist.</p>

<p>Firstly, the landscape combines great beauty with an imposing
grandeur. There is a luxuriance of vegetation which more than
rivals that of Southern Italy; and the glorious mountain masses,
with their scarped precipices, cannot be easily matched for their
form and colour.</p>

<p>The land is highly cultivated, and of a happy and cheerful
aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>It is thickly
populated, and the out-of-door life of the people, both as regards
their agricultural and pastoral occupations, is picturesque. Not
that these are strange in their character, on the contrary, they
have the charm of being simple world-wide performances, common to
all time.</p>

<p>The women, although Mohammedans, expose their faces with the
same freedom as Europeans.</p>

<p>The dress of the men consists of a tunic and burnous.</p>

<p>The artistic merit of this loose and extremely simple dress, is
not in the actual clothes, but in the manner of wearing them, which
is varied. From the arrangements of folds into which these garments
fall being ever changing, the artistic sense of the observer is
always kept alive. A man thus simply dressed, may by some chance
movement fling his cloak about his person, so that its masses and
folds assume a dignity and interest worthy of permanence in
sculpture. Such harmonies unfold themselves suddenly, and are
fleeting, but they are an incentive to endeavour to record
them.</p>

<p>I believe this is the only corner of the world, where the dress
of the women is still the same as the Greek dress of antiquity.
Though the Romans dominated North Africa, there is no reason to
suppose that it was introduced by them; because, in a certain
condition of society, it is the dress which common sense
dictates.</p>

<p>Gestures can be studied when the people are excited, but only
then. I should describe the ordinary manners of the Kabyles
as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span> gentle and calm;
but at times, when their passions are aroused, they are as vehement
as the storms that break the serenity of their climate. They are
not as a rule a fussy gesticulating people; on the contrary, at the
entrance to a village, a rustic row can always be found chatting
peacefully, and sitting very still. Nor is it only the old who thus
indulge in sunning themselves, though they can be seen there also,
who</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Wise through time and narrative with
age</div>

<div class="line indent0">In summer days like grasshoppers
rejoice,</div>

<div class="line indent0">A bloodless race that send a feeble
voice.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With us, it is by all classes felt that it is wise for a man to
keep his head as cool as he can, but the Kabyles, in the ordinary
way so quiet and gentle in demeanour, are an impulsive people,
careless of self-control, and a mere trifle is sufficient to
enflame them. They freely give reins to their feelings,
untrammelled by considerations which beset more civilised men; and
when passions have unrestrained play, gestures, which are the
pantomime of passion, are born.</p>

<p>Owing to their having remained uninfluenced by strangers, there
is a remarkable harmony between their manners and customs, and the
country they inhabit; and on account of the simplicity of life, the
reason for things being constructed and arranged as they are is
generally traceable, and this gives an agreeable impression. The
villages, for instance, seem to grow naturally out of the
mountains, and the dress of the people accords exactly with their
conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span> of life.
Their artificial surroundings are very meagre, hard, unalluring and
rude; but at any rate it is satisfactory to find them free from the
qualities of foolishness and insincerity; for when men seek simply
to satisfy their wants, they are sure to act sensibly, and,
according to their ability, adapt means to ends in the most direct
manner possible. There is no place for trick and sham; moreover,
when they decorate anything, they follow a simple tradition, but
keep their personal feeling and invention alive, and thus they
avoid the two sins of vulgarity and insipidity. All work so done,
however rude it may be, is respectable and interesting.</p>

<p>This sense of harmony is felt all the more strongly by glancing
for a moment at one of the new French settlements on the borders of
the same country, where its absence is conspicuous; it is at once
obvious, that such a village belongs to a complicated system of
society.</p>

<p>The Kabyle village is rude and simple, the French is mean
without being simple. It is built on the dusty high road, which can
be seen winding in a serpentine line like a white thread, through
the feverish plains. The road is traced in accordance with military
and strategic reasons, and it will be found that there is little
sign of traffic; a broad mule-track well trodden down, runs near,
following a straighter line though more uneven gradients. This
gives the road the appearance of being a sham. The village consists
of a collection of hideous little houses sprinkled about in the
plain, without shade from the pitiless sun, mean oblong<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span> boxes, quite unlike the
model of a <i>colon’s</i> house that was to be seen in the gardens
of the Trocadero at Paris in 1878, which showed a beautiful power
of idealising. A government order has fixed the colony in its
place, which so far as can be seen, might as well have been chosen
at any other point. An ugly little church has been just completed,
which the inhabitants do not appear either to respect or to want.
All the wood used in the construction of the buildings has been
brought from over the seas, from Norway, though the sides of the
hills are covered with trees. The most frequented place of meeting
is the dram-shop, where the heralds of civilisation congregate to
tipple absinthe. Speak to the colonists, you will find that they
abuse their homes and their circumstances; they one and all wish
that they were somewhere else, perhaps the only point on which the
natives are ready to agree with them. ‘Peut-être—oui, peut-être, le
pays est joli, mais vu du loin,’ is the nearest approach to praise
that I have been able to extract from a colonist in such a
village.</p>

<p>In England men adapt their lives to the requirements and the
accumulated conveniences of civilisation; but in a primitive
society, there is a forced accordance between man and surrounding
nature, which imposes its conditions upon life.</p>

<p>In Kabylia this agreement is visible in every particular and
detail of life. Those bronzed and furrowed features, those sinewy
limbs, do they not attest struggle and toil with nature? Watch
those girls as they trip down the mountain path; at every
step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span> their
movements are governed by the accidents of the ground. What a path
it is! Fit emblem of half-civilised institutions. Year after year,
year after year, it receives the impress of many feet, yet all the
rude asperities of nature remain.</p>

<p>Kabylia has I think another interest, purely fanciful. On seeing
the villages with tiled roofs set on the tops of the mountains,
surrounded by fig-trees; and corn ripening among the fine olives;
one is irresistibly reminded of Italy. But here, though the people
are of a different race and religion, they have retained the habits
of a very primitive age; and in this corner of the world, more than
anywhere in Europe, observation of the manners of to-day, will
picture the rural life of classic times.</p>

<p>Upon observing a phase of life so different from the world one
is accustomed to, it is agreeable to discover that in odd
unexpected ways, it connects itself in the mind, with a past whose
beauty remains recorded for our enjoyment.</p>

<p>Added to these points of interest that Kabylia offers to the
artist, there is the advantage that the climate is healthy and
invigorating.</p>

<p>I first visited this country in the early spring of the year
1873, when I spent several weeks there. I revisited it in the year
1877, when I remained over a month among the mountains, living part
of the time with Italians at an isolated farmhouse, and part of the
time with the Missionary Fathers. In the beginning of 1880, I again
returned and stayed a month at Fort National, and in
April<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span> started on the
expedition recorded in this narrative. On this last occasion I kept
a diary. On my return home, I found that my notes were too concise
to conjure up scenes to others; nevertheless they elicited so many
enquiries, that I resolved to expand them in my leisure hours. The
following is the result. In the hope that it may interest a wider
circle than my personal friends, I with diffidence submit it to
public criticism.</p>

<p class="chstart">EFORE leaving Algiers, my friend Muirhead and I
engaged a Frenchman as a servant, who undertook, in accompanying
us, to guard the tent during our absence, and to cook.</p>

<p>This matter being arranged, he went with us on a shopping
expedition, when we purchased the necessary kitchen utensils, and
got them packed in a conveniently shaped box. We filled our empty
tins with provisions, and supplied ourselves with a few medicines,
a precautionary measure that happily proved superfluous.</p>

<p>Muirhead bought an excellent folding camp-bed at Attaracks’, the
army purveyors. For myself, I took an Indian bullock-trunk,
containing clothes, books, and a store of photographic gelatine
plates; and a box with painting materials and a camera.
Folding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> irons by
uniting these two packages formed a bedstead, upon which a cork
mattress could be spread. A carpenter made for me a flat case to
hold canvases, which served also as an easel, having pieces of wood
so arranged on one side that they could be slipped down to form leg
supports. This proved convenient; it was strong, so simple that it
could not get out of order, and it could be adjusted so as to stand
firm however uneven the ground.</p>

<p>Our preparations completed, we took places in the diligence
leaving for Tizi-Ouzou, a French settlement on the borders of
Kabylia. We started April 6, 1880.</p>

<p>The diligence left at the inconvenient hour of eight o’clock in
the evening, and arrived at its destination at eight the following
morning; we had a very uncomfortable, sleepless ride, and at
Tizi-Ouzou only remained long enough to breakfast, after which we
took the omnibus for Fort National.</p>

<p>The fort is built in a commanding position, at the top of a
mountain 3,153 feet in height. The road at first passes through a
plain, crosses the river Sebaou, which is not bridged and is liable
to freshets after rain, when it becomes impassable.</p>

<p>The omnibus, on account of the snapping of one of the springs,
made unusually slow progress as it toiled along the zigzag road
leading up to the Fort. We consequently got out and walked most of
the way, taking short cuts, and greatly enjoying the deliciously
fresh air and fine scenery, and arrived at our destination between
one and two o’clock, when, having refreshed ourselves, we took a
turn outside the ramparts for the sake of the superb view from this
point. There was a grand tumble of mountains, range beyond range;
but what riveted our attention chiefly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_3">[3]</span> were the great peaks and rocky masses of the
Jurjura to the south.</p>

<p>As I already knew something of the country, and Muirhead saw it
for the first time, he said, ‘And what do you propose doing?’ I
accordingly suggested that we should go in the direction of the
high mountains, where we should be most likely to find points of
interest. There were two roads in front of us, both leading to
places suitable for camping. The first was on the crest of a
mountain range, studded with many villages that lay between us and
the peaks of the Jurjura, the seat of the Beni Ienni, one of the
best-known tribes in the country, where native jewellery and
cutlery is chiefly manufactured. The second was the home of the
Aïth Ménguellath; their mountain was not actually visible, being
hidden by the spurs of the one on which we were standing; it was
farther off, but more easy of access than the Beni Ienni, being
skirted by the French road to Akbou, the only one leading out of
the country in the direction of Constantine, Kabylia being
otherwise an ‘impasse.’ The latter tribe have in their midst a
school under the direction of three missionary Fathers, and the
former a school superintended by three Jesuit Fathers. We
anticipated that the presence of the good Pères would be of service
to us, considering our ignorance of the language.</p>

<p>At our feet, between us and the Beni Ienni, was a deep gulf. The
Kabyle road before us, rough and steep, led down into it,
apparently ending in the blue distance in a fine example of the
perpendicular; the other wound round to the left at a high level.
After a little talk over the matter, we decided to follow the
civilised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> line as the
easier, and to start for the Aïth Ménguellath the following
morning, provided that we could find mules. We soon found there was
no difficulty on this point, and five were promised to be ready at
an early hour. When several mules are engaged, each belonging to a
different owner, a considerable amount of excited talk and
gesticulation has to be got through before the traveller sees his
luggage finally packed and ready to start, for each mule-owner
naturally does his best to get the heavy pieces put on his
neighbour’s mule and the light pieces on his own. In the midst of
all this dispute and fuss, the mules stand patiently, but they have
a trick of striking out their legs, as if it were only just as much
as they could do to support their burdens; more luggage is heaped
on their backs, their expression of countenance grows more wistful
and dejected; but when everything is adjusted they prick up their
ears and start jauntily. We had three beasts, heavily laden, and
two riding-mules. It was a glorious, perfect morning; the sun warm,
the air brisk; and the great range of lofty mountains tipped with
snow looked most sublime. We caught the country in the very act of
bedecking itself with its spring mantle, for the mountain slopes
were covered with the bright fresh green of the young corn, and the
ash-trees in abundance were just opening their delicate leaves.</p>

<p>On the way we passed one or two small villages, and some
charming wooded gullies with falling streams. At such a spot was a
scene that caught my fancy. A party of girls had placed some
clothes on smooth rocks, in the run of the brook, and, barefooted,
were merrily dancing upon them; others were flopping about a
crimson dress, previous to wringing it, while more
clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> lay drying in
the sun on the grassy slope. Above them, offering shade for a
noontide repast, rose an elegant ash, with a great vine mazily
tangled up with and depending from its branches. The eastern end of
the mountain was not so verdant as the country we had already
passed, the ground being naturally more barren; but no square foot
of land capable of cultivation had been neglected, and it was
matter of wonder to see corn growing on slopes so steep that no one
could stand on them without some caution lest he should roll to the
bottom of the ravine; as, moreover, it was by no means obvious
where the bottom might be, and pretty evident that anyone rolling
down would have no sound bone left in his body by the time he
reached it, one could not but admire the plucky industry of the
Kabyles.</p>

<p>The house of the Missionary Fathers at length appeared in the
distance on a well-wooded ridge, the higher points of which were
crowned by three or four large villages.</p>

<p>The road now became unfit for carriages, and dwindled to a
mule-path, winding in an irregular fashion. We passed one
especially picturesque place, crowned by the white tower of a
mosque, with a fine group of evergreen oaks shading the rocky
corner of a cemetery. As we approached the Aïth Ménguellath, and
made the final ascent to the Mission House, the path was shaded by
avenues of ash-trees.</p>

<p>On knocking at the door of the school-house, we found only one
of the Fathers at home; he received us very politely, and refreshed
us with excellent wine, made on the lands of the fraternity at the
Maison Carrée, a few miles from Algiers, where is their mother
establishment. Their Superior is the Bishop of Algiers.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> Any young man desirous of entering
the society commences with a course of study in Arabic, at their
house at the Maison Carrée. They have four other schools in
Kabylia, besides this in the Aïth Ménguellath, which is the latest
founded, and the Jesuits have two establishments.</p>

<p>On the road, we had seen no level piece of ground suitable for
camping. In answer to our inquiries, the Father thought that
nowhere in the neighbourhood could be found a better place than
beside a small cemetery just beneath the school-house, where our
animals had that moment halted; we therefore lost no time in
unlading the mules, and dismissing our attendant Kabyles. We had
never before pitched the tent, which was a large and fine one,
unusual in its arrangements, and it took us some time to put it up;
we were much embarrassed by tombstones, these encroached so near
that it was next to impossible to peg down the tent. However, when
once it was up, with the lining, and our camp-beds and luggage
disposed within, it looked very comfortable. We determined that
while we remained dwellers beside tombs, however much the ghosts of
the departed might be perturbed at the unwonted presence of the
unfaithful, our peace should remain secure.</p>

<p>A few men had collected to watch our proceedings, and boys from
the school gathered round. They were a nice-looking set of lads,
bright and gentle-mannered, and we were glad to find that they
possessed a stock of French, slender though it was. The fire
flickered up, in preparation for our evening meal, the school-lads
in their white burnouses stood round, whilst through the trees the
Jurjura peaks grew dim in the fading light.</p>

<p>Our man, Domenique, came from the Pyrenees on the
Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> frontier; he
called himself a Frenchman, but he did not look like one, nor had
he the lively French manners. He was spare, of about forty, with
black straight hair and moustache, black eyes, under-cut mouth,
with marked lines about the jaw. From the beginning, Muirhead
declared him to be a man with a temper, which proved to be too
true; time also proved him to be a man of a bilious temperament,
utterly incapable of understanding a joke. ‘He is quite the Spanish
type,’ said Muirhead. I know not, but if Spaniards are apt to
resemble him, I hope I may never travel in their country.</p>

<p>We both of us marvelled greatly at the wonderfully meagre
preparation he had made for his personal comfort. He carried with
him nothing but a striped cloth, and a very thin green cardboard
box, done up with string. To the last, the contents of this package
were a mystery to us, but we believe that it contained a
shirt-front, and one or two collars.</p>

<p>Such unpreparedness, such despising of all worldly comfort,
should, we thought, be surely viewed from above by the saints with
approving smiles, and Saint Joseph especially should have regarded
with favour this extreme scantiness of scrip, which, judging from
pictures, should have reminded him of his own ‘Flight into
Egypt.’</p>

<p><em>Friday, April 9,</em> 1880.—We paid an early call at the
school-house, and saw the three Fathers. I found the Superior, Père
Gerboin, to be a friend. Two years previously, I had spent a week
at his house; he was then conducting a school in the tribe of the
Zouardia, and I was indebted to his hospitality for the opportunity
of seeing something of the tribes away from French
settlements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> He is a
most excellent, kindly man, devoted to his calling. One would take
him rather for an Italian than a Frenchman; short but strongly
built, he has a handsome head, with a deep brow, and a flowing
black beard, his bronzed features are set off by his white dress,
which is something between that of a Carmelite friar and a Kabyle
burnous.</p>

<p>The second, Père Voisin by name, whom I had not met, is almost a
giant, over six feet in height, and fair; a true Norman, from
Calvados, a jolly, lively fellow, his face a picture of good
nature, and he speaks Kabyle with the ease of a native.</p>

<p>Père Gerboin teaches the elder boys; Père Voisin takes in hand a
class of quite little fellows. About thirty scholars attend
regularly, but the numbers are increasing.</p>

<p>The third, Père Mousallier, we had spoken to on our arrival; he
is called by the natives Père Baba. He was busy making up and
distributing medicines, for he said there was much disease and
sickness about—not to be wondered at, considering the lack of
doctors, and the hard life led by many of the people. He spends a
good deal of his time in gardening, but does not take part in the
teaching.</p>

<p>Our visit was but short, for we started on a walk of
exploration, first directing our steps towards the highest point,
at the back of the school-house, where there are two villages,
separated by a small open piece of flat land. These are named
Ouarzin and Taourirt en Taïdith, meaning the Ogre, and the Mount of
the Dog. They are of the usual quaint character, narrow alleys,
running irregularly up and down, innocent of paving, though rich in
stones; in wet weather almost impassably muddy. The
stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> walls of the
houses, on either side of these alleys, are only pierced here and
there, with the smallest of windows, and the entrances. The wooden
doors are often ornamented with rough notchings and carvings. In
walking through these villages, attention is chiefly occupied in
looking out for dogs, which are apt to come dashing out of the
houses, barking in a most vicious manner, looking very much as if
they would relish a piece out of one’s leg. Taourirt boasts of a
Jamâ or Mosque. Its tower crowns the highest point of the mountain,
and forms an effective feature in the landscape, though it is a
modest structure both in size and style; moreover, the building is
greatly out of repair and falling to pieces, being little used, for
the Kabyles are not a mosque-going people; in this, as in other
respects, their character presents a strong contrast to that of the
bigoted Arabs.</p>

<p>I once asked a Kabyle why their mosques were abandoned. He
replied that, before they were conquered by the French, they used
to attend them very regularly, and that if Allah had cared about
their conduct, and paid attention to it, He would not have allowed
them to receive the kicks and cuffs of a too hard fate, such as
they had been subject to ever since. This man was clearly of a
practical bent of mind, and his God was the God of Battles. This is
a proof of ancient and respectable theological views, that have the
merit of being intelligible; their scientific notions seem to be
equally primitive.</p>

<p>On one occasion a group of Kabyles was standing round, when I
abruptly left off working, and began gathering my painting traps
together, for, said I, ‘I see the wind is blowing the clouds in
this direction, it will rain.’ ‘The wind does not push the clouds,’
said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> one, ‘you can
see them moving in different directions at the same time.’ ‘But
surely,’ said I, ‘you can perceive any day that it is the wind that
moves them.’ ‘Does the wind move the sun?’ said he. ‘No, of course
it doesn’t.’ ‘God said to the sun, Move always in one direction,
and to the clouds He said, Move about as you please.’ ‘Is that not
so?’ said he, appealing to his companions. They nodded gravely, and
clicked assent without speaking. This clicking with the tongue, the
same peculiar noise that a coachman makes to urge his horse, is a
habit with the Kabyles; it seems to be a sign of assent. For
instance, when painting, some men would come to see what I was
about. One would say, ‘See, he paints the cows!’—click! would go
all the others, like so many pistols being cocked. ‘See, he paints
the houses also!’—click! they went, all round again, but no report
followed—a feeble style of criticism.<a id=
"FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I have often noticed that in asking some simple question
concerning the weather—for instance, whether it was likely to turn
fine, or be wet—they seem to consider it presumptuous to hazard an
opinion on such a subject, that we should leave such matters alone,
and not think about them, they being no concern of ours,
but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> God’s. Their
manner implies that we should bear ourselves with a composed
spirit, above a petty, fretful, unmanly prying into the works of
the Lord. I have immediately dropped my eyes from the clouds to the
earth, feeling quite abashed and inclined to say, ‘Bless my soul!
why, so it is, now you mention it, I will not meddle with the
subject any more, and never, oh, never look at telegrams in the
“Times” concerning the wind, whence it cometh or whither it
goeth.’</p>

<p>Each village has usually three or four outlets, where there are
covered resting-places called Jamâs. These, like the houses, are of
rough blocks of stone, and have tiled roofs, they are thirty or
forty feet in length, and some twenty feet in breadth. The gangway
passes through the centre, and on each side are broad stone benches
where people can sit, or recline at ease in the cool shade. Men are
always to be found at these places, chatting, smoking, sleeping, or
may be stitching; for the men do all the tailoring, even to sewing
together lengths of cotton stuff, to make dresses for their wives;
the women weave but do not use the needle. These covered
resting-places may be considered as the centres of village
politics, for every village is divided into different parties, each
anxious to elect the Amine or chief, who has power to inflict fines
up to a certain amount.</p>

<p>The word Jamâ, the Arabic for mosque, means simply the place of
assembly. Friday is el Jemāa, the day of assembly, the Mohamedan
Sunday. The Aïth Ménguellath market is called Souk-el-Jemāa,
Friday’s market. The native name for Fort National is l’Arba, or
the fourth day, a market being held there every Wednesday. Before
French rule, the duty of the Amine in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_12">[12]</span> times of peace was to maintain the tribal
laws, in times of war he commanded the fighting men, but only to
carry out some plan previously determined on by the Jemāa. When
schemes of war on an extensive scale had to be executed, the Amines
of a tribe chose a President, who commanded the united tribal
force. Communal laws were collected into a complete code, called
Kanoun; these varied in different tribes, but only on points of
detail. In certain cases when these laws were unable to deal with
new circumstances, the Jemāa was called together and a decree
elaborated. An account of the Kanoun is given by C. Devaux, also by
le Baron H. Aucapitaine (‘Etude sur le passé et l’avenir des
Kabyles’). The latter says: ‘The Kanouns, the repositories of the
laws and customs of the Kabyles, are interesting specimens of the
political constitution of the democratic Berbers. We have searched
history in vain for the origin of this democratic system, forming
to-day the base of Kabyle justice.’ Several writers have thought
that the word Kanoun is derived from the Greek word κανών, an
opinion justified, says Aucapitaine, by the name still given to
codes in vigour among the Greek Christians of Albania. Among the
Miridites, justice is still administered after the ‘Canounes Sech’
preserved by tradition.</p>

<p>The village chief is still chosen by the majority of votes of
the heads of families met together in council. He is responsible to
the Kaïd, or President of the tribe, for the orderly conduct of the
village, and the President again is responsible to the Bureau Arabe
stationed at Fort National. The administration of the country is on
the point of being changed from the military to civilians, a vexed
question about which I have nothing to say. There is no<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> police of any sort among the
tribes. On asking a native what happens should a disturbance occur
at night, or should a robbery take place, he replied: ‘All the men
in the neighbourhood turn out of their houses to assist in quieting
matters and in securing the suspected party; the following day
there is a general talk and investigation into the matter before
the Amine.’</p>

<p>At the season when the figs are ripening, men keep watch in
their fields by night. Constructions of cane in the trees, looking
like huge nests, are to be seen, where men at that season pass the
night guarding the fruit.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country daring robbers, over whom the Amine
has no control, invade the plantations—Barbary apes, which live
among the high cliffs.</p>

<p>There are no shops in the villages. Were a man to open one, I
take it the Kabyles are too suspicious of being overcharged to go
in and buy. All the business of the country is done at the markets,
where there is a lively competition and everything is open and
discussable. Husbands, when at work, have the satisfaction of
knowing that their wives cannot squander their money in riotous
shopping; at any rate, they like their system of doing things, and
mean to stick by it. Though the markets be distant, they like the
walk to them, the company, the talk by the way, the concourse of
many tribesmen, the news from distant quarters, the eager
bargaining, the comparing of notes, the greetings of friends, the
disputes with enemies. Is it not all lively and amusing? Above
these merits in my eyes, is it not extremely picturesque?</p>

<p>From the open bit of ground between the villages of Ouarzin and
Taourirt the view of the Jurjura is magnificent. With the
early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> morning sun
behind, the rocks throw great blue shadows, and are superb in
colour, their formation is limestone, moulded in the grandest
forms, the loftiest peak is 7,542 feet. The village of Taourirt is
a trifle above the level of Fort National. Owing to the absence of
glacial action, the general character and form of the highest
mountains recurs in a curious way throughout the country—more or
less obliterated, however, by the action of water. As some peal of
thunder may re-echo until the softened reverberations die in
silence, so do the forms of the lofty crags repeat, until with
elegant lingering curves they finally plant themselves with quiet
precision upon the dead level of the plain. On this open ground,
just mentioned, are four or five mills for crushing olives. These
are very simple in construction. A basin about twelve feet in
diameter and three feet high is built of masonry, into this the
olives are poured. A heavy cross-beam supported at its extremities
by two others fixed vertically in the ground, passes over the
centre of the basin, and its object is to keep the grindstone in
its place, which is accomplished in the following manner. The
stone, in an upright position, works like a wheel round a pole
placed in the centre of the basin; this pole revolves, turning in a
socket at its lower extremity, and in another above, attached to
the overhanging beam. To the centre of the grindstone a long handle
is fixed, men and women, pushing and pulling at this, run round and
round the basin, and making the stone roll in the trough, which is
lined with flat slabs; it crushes the olives which are placed in
its way. It is about a foot in thickness, with the edge slightly
bevelled, to cause it to roll easily.</p>

<p>One of the mills had its stone dislodged and lying on its
side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> This, of a
reddish tinge tipped with bright light, looked like a mass of
porphyry against the amethyst colour of the mountain shadows.</p>

<p>When olives are plentiful the gathering lasts for several
months, beginning in October nor ending till February, and it is a
charmingly picturesque sight. Men standing round a tree beat down
the fruit with long wands, then they climb up to beat and shake the
branches, till all the berries have fallen. ‘As the shaking of an
olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough,
four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof,’ is a
Biblical simile for a small remnant. Upon a Greek vase in the
British Museum, an olive tree is depicted being stripped of its
fruit in the manner described.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the women are busy, working side by side, picking up
the fallen fruit and putting it into baskets, which are emptied on
to cloths spread on the ground. At close of day the heaped berries
are poured into sacks, and carried up to the villages on mules.</p>

<p>The olive is the chief wealth of Kabylia; it grows in the
greatest luxuriance. The lower slopes of the mountains are covered
with it, and some miles distant from Borj Boghni, at the foot of
the Jurjura, there is an especially grand old forest. The berries
are left lying in a heap for some days, during which time they
undergo a certain amount of fermentation. They are next poured into
round shallow depressions in the ground, made in an exposed spot,
sometimes they are placed on the roofs of the houses. Here the sun
ripens and softens them to the uttermost, extracting by evaporation
water contained in them,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_16">[16]</span> and allowing the pulpy part to be easily
disengaged from the kernel. They now look all shiny with oil, are
of the deepest purple colour, and ready to be carried to the mill,
where they are crushed in the manner I have described:</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Then olives, ground in mills, their
fatness boast.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The oil is extracted from the mass by pressure. A square block
of masonry about a yard in height, contains a stone basin at the
top of it, and a hole at the bottom of the basin allows the oil
running out to be collected. Flat bags of alfa grass, filled with
the crushed olives, are piled in the basin, a heavy flat piece of
wood placed on the top, and pressure is brought to bear, by means
of a wooden screw, which passes through a strong cross-beam,
supported by two stout upright poles. The remains of the pressed
mass are carried to some stream, where holes about three feet deep
are arranged so that water from the stream can enter and afterwards
be allowed to run off. When the holes are filled, the remains of
the olives are thrown in, the women tuck up their dresses and jump
in too, beating and knocking the mass about, and the refuse dirty
water is allowed to escape.</p>

<p>Soap is manufactured from the oily residue, by mixture with wood
ashes.</p>

<p>But to return from this digression. We went from Taourirt to
Tamjoot, about a mile distant and somewhat lower, on one of the
arms of the mountain. The rocky pathway passed through a little
open cemetery, where a beautiful group of cork and ash formed a
leafy bower above. In the background, the little village appeared
perched on a prominence, and the picture was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_17">[17]</span> completed by the magnificent outline and
precipices of the mountains.</p>

<p>We stood watching for some time groups of picturesque peasants
issuing from the shade, and making their way to the market below;
some, bearing goods done up in skins; some, earthenware pots netted
together with twisted grass cords; others driving sheep and goats,
asses and cattle. There is not much to be gained by entering the
villages; they look best from the outside, and Tamjoot was not an
exception to the rule. We halted at the Jamâ at the entrance, and a
friendly Kabyle brought us clotted sour milk and figs, with which
we refreshed ourselves. We returned by another path, overhung the
greater part of the way with ash; the land was well cultivated with
corn, and bore besides a profusion of fig-trees and evergreen oak.
On arrival at the tent, we were glad to find that Dominique had not
been inactive, and we did justice to his first ‘déjeuner.’</p>

<p>Each mountain has its tribe—Qabïla is the Arabic word for tribe,
Qabaïli, a tribesman—and the villages are all built on the crests.
The reason for this is apparent from a mere glance at the country,
the slopes are so extremely steep that there is no other place
where they could easily be built, and the gorges are occupied only
by the stony beds of torrents; the springs also are found generally
not far from the summits. Such situations have the advantage of
fine healthy air, free from fevers; and in unsettled times, before
the French introduced regular government, they no doubt to a great
extent afforded the inhabitants immunity from the attacks of their
neighbours.</p>

<p>From all accounts, in the good old days, the tribes were
constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
quarrelling, and thus found distraction from the monotony of a too
uneventful existence.</p>

<p>The area of country enclosed between the sea and the Jurjura, is
about 3,850 square miles. The number of armed men at the time of
the conquest, has been estimated at 95,000. Reckoning a little less
than three times as many women and children, gives a total of
350,000 souls, or the high rate of 90 per square mile.</p>

<p>No village shows any signs of fortifications, or preparations
for defence. The deep gulf fixed between the mountains, practically
keeps the different groups of villages far more separated from each
other than if they were built on islands. Before the French
occupation, the people used always to go about armed. C. Devaux, a
captain of Zouaves, has thus described a fight in the old times; it
is full of picturesque suggestion:—</p>

<p>‘In the case of a village not having a sufficient number of
fighting men to hold the field, when about to be attacked by
superior forces, the defenders hastened to arrange means of
resistance. Trenches were dug and mounds raised, according to the
position of the ground to be defended, the outlets of the streets
were closed by walls of piled stones, and at the moment of attack,
each man occupied the place assigned him.</p>

<p>‘The women, young and old, joined in the fray; in their gala
dresses, bedecked with their jewellery, and holding each other’s
hands, they chanted a war-song, and from time to time raised
thrilling cries to inflame the courage of the defenders. These
songs, these war-cries of the women, heard in the midst of the
fusillade, produce a most vivid effect. Having many times been
called on to conduct Kabyle contingents at the defence of
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> village menaced by
the enemy, I have felt, when I heard the exciting cries of the
wives and mothers, how greatly they touch the fighting fibre of the
combatants.</p>

<p>‘Things are managed differently when the French attack; then the
women are sent into the mountains with the children and the flocks
and herds; for in case of the village being taken they would be
made prisoners, whilst between Kabyles the women were always
released, and in no instance was any insult offered them.’</p>

<p>I am afraid that when the French attacked, the women were not
always so comfortably sent out of the way as this officer
describes, and that they fared badly. One day an old soldier was
abusing the Kabyle women to me. ‘C’est incroyable,’ said he,
‘comment sont méchantes les femmes Kabyles.’ I asked him to be kind
enough to descend from generalities to particulars. He thereupon
described an attack on a village, at which he had been present,
when the women had assisted the men in the defence. He told me how,
when the bullets were flying, he and a comrade had rushed at the
doorway of one of the houses; his friend, a few paces in advance,
killed a Kabyle just as he was levelling his gun to fire; but
vengeance was instant, there was the flash of a pistol, his comrade
fell dead; rushing on, he made a plunge with his bayonet, and on
withdrawing it, behold! he had run it through the body of the
Kabyle’s faithful wife. ‘Vous voyez, monsieur,’ he concluded,
‘comment sont méchantes les femmes Kabyles.’</p>

<p>The extreme timidity of the women to this day, running away, as
they often do, in the most idiotic manner on the first sight of a
European, arises of course from their fears at the time of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> war. It seems
clear that in former times the fighting that occurred among the
Kabyles was, as a rule, of a much milder nature than a war against
an invader. They fought about points of honour, or personal
dignity. When a tribe thought itself insulted by another and sought
vengeance, it would send the young men to attack the flocks and
herds, the animals taken in a <i>coup de main</i> were slaughtered
and the meat distributed among the tribe.</p>

<p>From that moment they made ready for war. Skirmishing would
begin; the marabouts, or priests, would then enter the field as
conciliators, but as they knew from experience that by reasoning
they would not succeed in extinguishing animosity, they tried to
calm matters by making conditions, such as, that they should not
fight at night, or that on such and such days fighting should be
suspended. However, if one of the parties was greatly irritated by
losses or insults, the voice of the marabouts was not listened to,
and matters often became very serious; they would attack day or
night at any hour, all communication was interrupted, they dug
trenches, houses were burned, trees cut down, and, in short, they
did all the harm they could. In the ordinary way the warriors of
both sides betook themselves to the spot set apart by custom for
finishing quarrels, and there fought in the manner of
sharpshooters. Each combatant sought to approach as near as
possible, gliding from bush to bush; and when within easy range,
his gun resting on the branch of a tree, or a stone, he would fire
and then retire without troubling to see if he had hit.</p>

<p>When two Kabyles fight without weapons, they claw like wild
cats, a disgusting way of fighting. Once during my stay in the
tribe of the Zouardia, two men, close to where I was<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> painting, began to fight about a
boundary. A herdsman had driven his cows on to a pasture which he
believed to be communal property; another man, meeting him, told
him to walk off, because he himself only had a right over the land,
having rented it of the commune. They forthwith began mauling and
clawing at each other’s faces; matters were becoming serious, and I
had just sharpened my pencil to try and sketch them, when a third
party at work near, separated them; they calmed down almost
immediately, each rather pleased with himself at having shown that
he was game to fight. On coming up to me, I tried to explain that
in England men fought with the fist; thereupon they grinned
good-naturedly. I have been shown an iron claw that is sometimes
worn on the hand when fighting, a very nasty and dangerous weapon,
answering to the American knuckleduster. The wagmuck, an iron claw
fixed upon the hand, is an historical weapon of the Deccan.
Sivajee, the founder of the Maharatta Empire, murdered Afzul Khan
with it—an incident introduced by Colonel Meadows Taylor into his
novel of Tara.</p>

<p class="nind">All the world has heard of the fighting qualities
of the Kabyles under the name of Turcos. I have often talked with
natives who took part in the Franco-German war, who have recounted
to me their experiences of Sedan, their long journey into Germany,
and how they nearly died of cold.</p>

<p>Though each mountain extends over a large area, the
summit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> is very
limited; this is especially the case in the tribe of the Aïth
Ménguellath. In the afternoon we took a walk of exploration down
the backbone of our mountain, we had gone but a few minutes, when
we faced an eminence covered with clustered houses, and a short
distance beyond was a second village-crowned knoll. A curious
effect was caused by the shadows of trees cast in straight lines
downwards upon the corn-covered slope, looking like reflections in
a liquid sea of green, the extraordinary freshness of the colouring
was heightened by the deep blue ranges beyond. Farther, we came
upon an open space covered with tombs and evergreens.</p>

<p>At one end of this cemetery was a little white Kouba, or chapel,
built over the tomb of a celebrated marabout, with coloured tiles
round the doorway. It was shaded by a group of oaks, while on one
side we caught a peep of the village set on the hill; one of these
trees, which overhangs the path, has a quantity of little dirty
bits of rag tied to the branches by women. It is not uncommon to
come across some insignificant-looking bush covered with tatters;
sometimes alongside is a niche made for a lamp, where simple
offerings, such as a few handfuls of figs, are left. Certainly the
bits of rag cannot be called offerings; they are left in
recognition of the holy man buried there, equivalent to leaving a
card in passing, an act at which no offence can possibly be taken,
and which perchance may be regarded by the deceased as a pleasing
attention. Hard by lives a marabout known to the people as Uncle
Zaïd, an old man who looks after the chapel, and does a great deal
of praying. We now found ourselves upon a grassy space, where
shepherds pasturing their flocks were sitting under<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> the shade of ilexes. Before us
rose a steep ascent, crowded with a mass of lichened tombstones, of
a beautiful warm grey; and growing among them were ilexes, corks,
and figs trained into leafy canopies above the graves, and
pomegranates crimson with budding leaves. The hill was crowned by
Thililit. Skirting the cemetery was a path among rocks, up and down
which charming groups of women and girls, with pitchers on their
heads, passed to and fro from the fountain; unfortunately they were
timid as deer, and on seeing us, fled in a scared way behind the
shelter of trees, from which they peeped out spying, till we had
passed. We walked through Thililit, and the path continued with
equal interest beyond. Passing a little plateau, we arrived at the
second village, that we had seen at a distance appearing above the
first; this was Aourir-Amer-ou-Zaïd. The ridge continued in a
straight line half a mile further, and led to Iril Boghni, but we
postponed a visit thither. We felt that another walk in this
direction was imperative, if it were only for a chance of catching
sight of a girl who was talking merrily with her neighbours at the
door of her house in the village of Amer-ou-Zaïd. She certainly was
the most beautiful girl we met in the country, rich-complexioned,
dark-eyed, with handsome features, and a supple graceful figure.
Alas! we never saw her again. ‘O maiden with delicate features,
thou resemblest Stamboul, for thou hast many admirers.’</p>

<p class="chstart">HE features of the landscape below Thililit
combined so happily together from many points that, upon a second
visit, we agreed this spot was as choice as the heart of painter
could desire, and provided more subjects than we could grapple
with.</p>

<p>On our walk, Uncle Zaïd, a benevolent, white-bearded gentleman,
accosted us, and offered cakes. By and by, we met Père Voisin
reading his breviary, who said there was much talk in the villages
concerning us, and questionings as to what we had come for, why
were we staring, why prying about the country in that way? Did not
the pulling out of paper and pencils mean mischief? Were we not
‘Géomètres’ come to trace out new roads? and would they, the
Kabyles, be forced to work on them? He told us he had reassured
them, explaining that we were Englishmen, and had nothing to do
with the Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span><em>Sunday,
April</em> 11, 1880.—It blew hard during the night, and there was a
heavy fall of rain, it was cold too, so that the unprepared
Dominique was half-frozen to death, and we, not having more clothes
than were quite necessary for ourselves, were forced to borrow
wraps from the Fathers. On waking, behold, we were in the clouds
and drizzle, unable to see many yards, so we determined to mark
Sunday in the time-honoured fashion, by lying late a-bed. It rained
all day, and we left the tent, only to take a constitutional under
umbrellas.</p>

<p>The evening was spent with the Fathers. Père Gerbouin lent us a
pamphlet printed for private circulation, giving an interesting
account of a French missionary expedition to the Equatorial Lakes.
A Brother, whom I had known when staying, two years previously, in
the tribe of the Zouardia, had taken part in this expedition, and
they had just learned the news of his death, at which they much
grieved; nor was he the only victim, for several others had
succumbed to privations and fevers. Père Gerbouin was very
enthusiastic on the subject, and greatly wished to join a fresh
expedition that is to start from Algiers for Lake Victoria. He
would be the right man in the right place; for besides his
enthusiasm he is tough and strong. He thought it a disgrace, at a
time when England and Protestants are making such exertions in this
field of enterprise, that France and the Roman Catholic Church
should lag behind. Evidently the cannibals will shortly be placed
in the delicate position of having to choose between rival sects of
the same religion.</p>

<p>The Père also told us of the privations they had to endure while
their present school-house was being built; how winter
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> overtaken them,
and they had to live in huts in the snow. They also recounted many
odd stories about our neighbours, and of the hard life led by the
poor.</p>

<p>In Kabyle society, the social unit is the family. The
possessions of a family are held in common, and are administered by
the father; at his death, by the son deemed to be the most capable
to manage affairs. The gains of each member of the family are
joined in a common fund. The exclusion of women to inheritance is
the consequence of this organisation, for, if the daughters
inherited like their brothers, the division of goods would bring
about the dispersal of the family.</p>

<p>Polygamy is lawful, but unusual, for the Kabyles as a rule are
too poor to be able to afford more than one wife. The women all
marry as soon as they arrive at the age of puberty. There is no
written contract at marriage. A Taleb—that is to say, a man knowing
how to read—recites the first and fourth chapters of the Koran,
there is no other religious ceremony. Before parting with his
daughter, the father receives a certain sum, which varies according
to her age, beauty, and her qualifications for making a good
housewife, and according to the means of her intended husband.
Sometimes part of the price is given in a provision of corn and
figs. The father gives his daughter as a marriage portion a girdle
and jewellery; these become her personal property, which no man can
take from her. If the father has received the price of his
daughter, and she should happen to die before the consummation of
marriage, he retains the money. If the husband die, leaving his
widow childless, she returns to her father, who marries her again
as he pleases. If she have children, her father cannot<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> give her in marriage without her
consent; and if she pay him an equivalent to what he would expect
to receive from a man desiring marriage with her, she becomes free
from all paternal restraint. This money is kept in trust for her
children. If she marry, her husband, who has had nothing to pay,
engages to take care of the children, who remain in the house with
their mother. If a woman refuse to live with her husband, she
returns to the paternal roof, when she becomes known as a ‘rebel.’
The husband still has rights, and can forbid her marrying anyone
else; he may allow her to do so, provided the father consent, in
which case the latter receives the supplementary sum to be paid. A
widow can only re-marry after mourning four months and ten days; a
divorced woman must wait three months. A man having repudiated his
wife cannot take her back without paying again, and having the
marriage ceremony re-performed. In case of separation, the children
are brought up by the father.</p>

<p>Conjugal infidelity has to be avenged with blood. In the Beni
Ienni I heard of several cases of savage murder from this
cause.</p>

<p>Two brothers, one of twenty, the other fifteen, having
constantly been about the tent since our arrival, we engaged the
younger, who was very anxious to make himself useful, and knew a
few words of French, to do little commissions. Kabyle verbs have an
habitual form. As the elder was an adept in putting into practice
the verb to ‘loaf,’ we nicknamed him the habitual loafer. We now
learned with astonishment that the habitual loafer had just taken
to himself a second wife. Having no ready money, in order to obtain
one, he had offered the parents of the girl to whose hand he
aspired, a patch of land in pledge, until he should be
able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> to pay off the
debt. After two months of troubled married life he sent the girl
back to her parents, I know not upon what plea. These naturally
claimed the field, but the youth’s mother (his father was dead)
brought proof that the land had been given to her. The returned
girl got no recompense, though free to marry again. The late
husband began making fresh advances to another girl. Number two
took better precautions; moreover, the habitual-loafer promised to
earn a certain sum of ready money before marriage, and he started
to seek his fortune in Algiers. After a three months’ absence, he
turned up with thirty sous in his pocket; the young lady however
was not <i>difficile</i>, and with an eye perhaps on the land—it
could not have been on her lover—accepted him in spite of his
meagre success.</p>

<p>Some of the well-to-do natives engage private instructors to
teach their sons Arabic and the Koran, but this is rare; such a
teacher is living in the village of Thililit, where he conducts a
school. Reclining under the shade of the ilexes, we heard the
voices of the children chanting the Koran, a native by our side,
perceiving how our attention was occupied, pointing in that
direction, said, ‘Kief kief Afrouken’ (just like the birds). When
Kabyle is written, the Arabic characters are adopted. Among the
Touaregs, a Berber people more to the south, an indigenous alphabet
is in use. General Hanoteau translates some sentences thus written,
which were inscribed by a woman on the shield of a Touareg chief.
The writing is from right to left, and decipherment is complicated
by the omission of vowels, and of divisions between words. Poor
vowels, they often fare badly. Even in ordinary Arabic writing they
are much snubbed, treated<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_29">[29]</span> as superfluous luxuries, and hustled out of
the way by self-sufficient consonants, and never meet with the
frank recognition due to their merit. In the Koran they certainly
fare better, everything is as perfect as possible, and all vowels
are introduced, but even then they are poor little things above and
below the line, attendant upon a sturdy row of consonants. In the
cellars of the British Museum are a few ancient Lybian
inscriptions. There is one bilingual stone, Phœnician and Berber.
This ancient Berber writing is almost identical with that still in
use among the Touaregs.</p>

<p><em>Monday, April</em> 12, 1880.—Another wet morning and dense
mist. I occupied myself with studying Kabyle. Before leaving
Algiers, M. Stora, a Jew, ‘interprète à la cour d’assise,’ gave me
a few lessons, the only man of education I could hear of, who had
knowledge of the language. I paid him about a dozen short visits,
when he kindly gave me all the assistance he could. I also carried
with me a Kabyle grammar, written some years ago by General M.
Hanoteau, and a French and Kabyle dictionary, compiled by the
Jesuits, which proved most useful.</p>

<p>The ignorance of the French concerning the language is
remarkable, considering the large Berber population they have to
govern. I believe there are some half-dozen Europeans at Fort
National with some smattering, but the only Europeans who
thoroughly understand it are the Fathers.</p>

<p>The colonists, forced into contact with the natives, get into
the habit of speaking a debased pidgin language, a mixture of bad
Arabic, French, and Spanish, but sometimes they do not even attain
this. For instance, Mme. Pierre at Fort National has<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> kept an hotel there for
twenty-five years, and has dealings with the natives at all hours;
she does not know a single word of Kabyle, nor can she put together
a single sentence in Arabic. When ‘colons’ cannot make the natives
understand, the ‘cochons d’indigènes’ are in fault for not learning
French. Our man Dominique was a spirit of this nature; he had
roughed it for years amongst an Arab population in the province of
Oran; to the best of my belief, his stock of Arabic consists in the
magic words ‘Goul’ and ‘Jib hadda,’ by which he means to express
‘take’ and ‘bring that.’ On arrival among the mountains, he
remarked, ‘Ici on parle arabe avec un dialecte très différent de
celui d’Alger.’ I doubt whether, on leaving the country, he was
aware that they spoke a language altogether distinct from Arabic.
As an instance of his incapacity for picking it up: he took in
fresh milk for our breakfast daily during two months and a half;
the last morning he was with me, after removing to another tribe,
when in bed, I was amused to overhear him vainly striving to
express his desire for milk, but unable to make the puzzled native
understand.</p>

<p>The weather gradually cleared; we sallied out in good spirits,
and planted our easels at the foot of the cemetery of Thililit. We
were quickly surrounded by a little crowd, who sat down to watch
our proceedings, and remained the whole afternoon chatting
good-humouredly. Having discovered their mistake in believing us to
be agents of Government come to trouble them in some way, they now
seemed to be very pleased, and kept repeating ‘Inglese buono,’
‘Français,’ then they shook their heads, and spoke earnestly. We in
our turn took to shaking our heads, and the Kabyles seemed
disappointed that we could not understand them.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> In civilised countries, if
curiosity should bring a spectator to a painter’s side, he would
probably say to himself after a while, ‘Now I must not waste time,
I must be off and do something.’ In the more easy-going south, a
Kabyle so placed would more probably say to himself, ‘Ah! here’s an
opportunity for a new occupation, to watch this man.’</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, April</em> 13, 1880.—It blew mightily during the
night, the wind roaring in the gulf beneath, and rushing over the
crest on which our tent was pitched, canvas shook and pole
trembled; and the possibility of tent-pegs being drawn, or cords
snapping, caused us unpleasant reflections. On waking in the
morning, we found a group of Kabyles waiting outside. They brought
four handsome women’s garments, and bargaining began, which ended
in our buying these dresses cheaply, considering the labour
bestowed upon them. ‘It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer;
but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.’</p>

<p>Besides satisfaction in possessing these cloths as costumes, we
found them serviceable as warm coverlets, and were able to return
the wraps we had borrowed; of this we were glad, thinking that the
Fathers had none too many for themselves.</p>

<p>The Amine or village chief of Taourirt, next made his appearance
with some friends to offer hospitality, saying that, if agreeable,
he would send us a kouskous that evening. We thanked him, and said
we should be very pleased; he had hardly departed when the Amine of
Ouarzin, approaching, offered us the hospitality of his village,
another kouskous for mid-day. We got one of the schoolboys to
explain, if it were agreeable to him, we should like it deferred,
thinking it impossible to eat two mountains of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_32">[32]</span> kouskous. The Ouarzinites were not going
to be cut out in that fashion, so we had to accept; before mid-day
the dishes appeared. The company consisted of the Amine and some of
the village counsellors, and three marabouts; there was a large
bowl containing the kouskous well piled up, a boiled fowl, with a
jug of sauce, another full of sour milk, a dish of boiled eggs,
delicious honey, and dried figs. Kouskous is wheat ground roughly;
two women grind it, sitting on the ground facing each other. The
appropriateness of the Biblical saying is then apparent (‘two women
shall be grinding at the mill, the one shall be taken and the other
left’). Water-mills are also constructed on some of the streams.
The flour is slightly moistened, passed through a sieve, and rolled
out with the hand till it takes the form of little balls about the
size of fine shot; this is boiled, moistened with gravy, and
seasoned with pepper. Like macaroni, it is a wholesome satisfying
dish. Placed in the midst of the company, each guest is served with
a round wooden spoon, with which he attacks the heap, gravy is
constantly poured on; in eating the chicken, he has to make use of
his fingers.</p>

<p>The Pères joined in the meal; with their help we were able to
follow the conversation. A discussion arose between the two
principal marabouts, as to whether photography and the painting of
portraits is ‘hareem,’ ‘a thing prohibited;’ the elder, the more
liberal-minded, contended that there was no harm in the matter, the
other declared that there was; the elder, being a Hadj, was voted
to have most authority. The third marabout, a man with
light-coloured hair and dull expression, had nothing to say. I
think kouskous must have got into his head. One of the
Amine’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> friends
started the opinion that if a man possessed the portrait of another
he also possessed a power to work him mischief; though he could not
say he believed it himself, others did; might there not be some
truth at the bottom of the notion? Was it proved certainly false
that if one man bearing malice were to bury another’s portrait, the
original of the likeness would sicken and die? This belief was much
ridiculed, though they had all heard it before. We expressed regret
at not having our cartes-de-visite to offer, that he might plant
them in his garden.</p>

</div>

<p>When we had finished, the dishes were handed to Dominique, who
served himself, while muttering his disgust at native cookery. The
rest then made a circle, and the remaining provisions were quickly
disposed of.</p>

<p>After the feast, we took a walk to Iril Boghni, the last village
on the backbone of the mountain. On the way we had to pass the
house where lived the beautiful girl; we hoped to catch sight of
her, but the door was shut, and she would not come out. A Kabyle
was sitting at the corner carving wooden spoons with an adze; we
took the greatest interest in his occupation, and stood a long time
watching; it was no good, the rude envious door was determined not
to change the direction of its face, and hid the beauty from us. On
our way back I made a great effort to converse in Kabyle with a man
who addressed us. He seemed amused—I dare say with good reason—but
politely invited us to step into his house. I thought he was making
straight for the home of the beautiful girl—how attentive of
him!—no, unluckily it was the next house that he entered.</p>

<p>We sat down at the entrance of a dark smoky room. He<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> spoke to a woman, who rose from
her seat behind a loom; she went out and brought in milk and figs;
resuming her work, the busy fingers were alone distinct, the
threads of the loom forming a thin veil before her figure. This
humble-minded artist was weaving a dress with elaborate patterns;
yet she had no design before her to help, and moreover had to
manufacture her own machine and arrange the threads. I was
astonished at the simplicity of the loom; the warp was fixed in an
upright frame made out of canes; she used no shuttle, but passed
the woof from side to side with her fingers, and jammed it home
tight with a metal handcomb, a most laborious method of weaving.
But because the mechanical means were rude, let not the reader
imagine that the work was so, for exactly the reverse is the truth.
She brought an old dress made some years before, much used, but
most beautiful in workmanship, design, and colour—indeed, as a
piece of colour it excelled all other woven cloths that we saw in
that part of the country. I made her understand that I had bought
some dresses, and that I should like to possess that one, but she
seemed loath to part with it. ‘Give her of the fruit of her hands,
and let her own works praise her in the gates.’ ‘She is not afraid
of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed
with double garments.’ She was past middle age, and strength and
sight seemed to be failing; she had lost the sight of one eye,
sitting ever working in that smoky atmosphere. A young and comely
woman, probably her daughter, tended a sleeping babe, gently
swinging its cradle slung from a beam in the roof.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">

<div class="line indent0">So from her babe, when slumber seals his

<div class="line indent0">The watchful mother wafts th’ envenom’d

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>As I
watched the figure of the weaver, distinct or half lost according
as it approached or receded from the web before it, while the busy
fingers peeped out now here, now there, moving ceaselessly, I was
reminded of the description of the handmaids in the Palace of
Alcinous:</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Some ply the loom; their busy fingers

<div class="line indent0">Like poplar leaves when Zephyr fans the

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">I could not help contrasting her with those ladies
at home who take part in the movement for Art needlework. I also
unsuccessfully attempted to learn the nature of the dyes employed,
and was shown some mysterious gummy substances. I could not
understand a word of what the good woman said, but am under the
impression that she must have been explaining that they were ‘Art
colours.’</p>

<p>Let it be here remarked, that the women’s dresses are not
dresses at all in the sense of being garments made up, or cut out;
they are simply pieces of drapery disposed about the body, fastened
beneath the shoulders with brooches, and confined at the waist with
a girdle; but for the girdle and the overlapping of the edges of
the cloth, the wearer’s person would be disclosed on one side. The
width of the loom is the same as the measure from the chin to the
ground. This given, weaving is continued until the cloth is
completed; the length usually being twice the width; but sometimes
they are made twice as long, giving a double thickness when worn.
Shorter pieces are also woven, an extra protection for the back;
these are fastened to the shoulder-pins, and confined by the
girdle, but show the underdress about the bosom, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> for a few inches above the
ankles. When the wearer sits down, this extra piece is seen
enveloping the thighs and knees, while the underdress droops
through below, in the way so often represented in Greek statues and
bas-reliefs. Formerly I used to regard this arrangement as simply
an agreeable artistic device, for allowing the folds of the outer
garment to contrast with those below; it was not until I visited
Kabylia, that I perceived that its true <i>raison d’être</i> was
protection for the back. Before returning, we went to watch the
women draw water at the fountain. There were groups of fine women
showing well-rounded arms and necks, as they walked in a stately
way with Greek-looking vases on their heads.</p>

<p>Many of these handsome girls could not, I think, be
distinguished from Italians, if transported to San Germano or
Atina, and dressed like Italian peasants; but the majority are of
course not handsome, and there is a type of countenance which is
peculiar, as though there might be some admixture of Tartar
blood—broad faces with marked cheek-bones, and thickish lips. Their
hair is always of a raven black; I imagine they sometimes add that
which they think nature lacks, because the men are not all
dark-haired. The colour that warms the cheeks of these brunette
beauties is also sometimes due to feminine art.</p>

<p>The men have good-shaped heads and marked features; before
middle age they are strongly bronzed, furrowed, and rugged; most
wear black moustachios and beards; now and then one will be found
with hair as red as any Scotchman’s. There is
undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> more
variety than amongst the Arabs. The Arab has a high prominent nose,
with a droop in the line of the nostril, like Dante’s nose; full
projecting lips and invariable black hair. The Kabyle is wanting in
all this; he is lower of stature, but has more expression of
countenance. Unfortunately, the children have not the delicate
beauty comparable to what one sees in an Arab town like
Tlemcen.</p>

<p>At evening came our second kouskous from hospitable Taourirt.
When all was finished, we handed round cups of tea—a beverage the
Kabyles were not acquainted with, and appreciated; at dusk they
took their departure.</p>

<p>The wind during the afternoon had dropped, but the atmosphere
was ominously murky and sultry, the mountains barely visible,
patches of snow on their summits just showing above their shadowy
bodies. When the Kabyles left, the wind was rapidly rising, while a
black dangerous-looking cloud stretched itself from one horizon to
the other, the sky on either side remaining clear.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, April</em> 14, 1880.—What a night this was a
prelude to! Soon the wind, straight from the tops of the Jurjura,
came rushing and raging over the abyss below, and shook our tent,
as if it were a leaf on the point of parting from its bough. About
midnight there was a lull; we hoped that the worst was past. No; we
had as yet been treated only to the overture; the winds, which
seemed to have been collecting and gathering evil strength in the
valleys, suddenly rushed onwards again like wild beasts determined
to destroy us, roaring as they swept in fury through the trees. I
never heard such a storm, and we were sorely afraid that no tent
could stand it for long; sleep was out of the question, we sat up
all night ready against any emergency, for we<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[38]</span> dreaded a catastrophe every moment. The
central support was made of iron tubing, with a cap at the top;
this latter was carried away early in the evening—a mishap that let
in the wind between the canvas and the lining; some of the
attachments gave way, and the lining flapped in an ungovernable
manner. When it became light enough to examine, we found most of
the wooden pegs pulled out of the ground, and the ropes fastened to
gravestones broken; six long irons only, driven in up to their
heads, remained firm and had saved us. Thankful we were that the
tent was standing; it had stuck on bravely to the mountain, like a
limpet to a rock, when the rising waves rush over it. It was a
sirocco not to be forgotten. ‘As whirlwinds in the south pass
through, so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.’ Later
in the day, the wind somewhat abated in its fury, but we remained
in the tent, glad to take some repose.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we searched for a fresh camping-ground, as it
was impossible to remain in safety where we were; this was not easy
to find, uncultivated land being restricted, and not sufficiently
level. We concluded that there was only one practicable spot, the
corner of a fallow field, thoroughly protected from the sirocco by
the hill; the next thing was to get permission to camp there.</p>

<p>Père Voisin good-naturedly helped us. The owner of the field was
absent, but the Amine of Ouarzin gave leave, saying no one would
disturb us. This settled, we lost no time; a party of Kabyles came
down to lend help; half-an-hour later all our effects were
transported on their backs to the spot, and as night fell, the tent
was well pitched in its new position, and the fire lit to prepare
our evening meal. On turning into bed, we congratulated
ourselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> for we
heard the tempest, howling and raging with renewed fury, above; but
before reaching us its strength was broken and lost in the
surrounding trees, and the tent remained in peace and quiet.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, April</em> 15, 1880.—Several paths converged at
the point where we now found ourselves, the most frequented being a
steep lane leading to the fountain. It was shaded by trees whose
branches interlaced elegantly with pretty peeps on to the distance;
from the entrance to our tent we looked straight down this lane,
towards the spring about two hundred yards off. The word ‘spring’
would suggest to most people simply water bubbling up and running
off in a diminutive stream; a better word to use in this instance
is ‘fountain,’ the French ‘fontaine,’ which has a different meaning
to ‘spring,’ ‘source’—inasmuch as it implies a basin, artificial or
natural, combined with a natural welling-up of water.
Unfortunately, the word ‘fountain’ is applied also to contrivances
by which water is made to spout, the French ‘jet d’eau.’ The Kabyle
fountain in question is a natural spring rising in the centre of a
basin inclosed in a rude architectural structure, having a double
arched entrance and gabled roof. The water is thus protected from
dirt, dust, and the heat of the sun. By the side where the women
fill their pots is a second structure, much dilapidated, reserved
for the watering of beasts. The overflow is conducted into a basin
where the women wash clothes, and then runs gurgling down the
mountain-side. In an embowered nook, where there are neat terraced
beds of vegetables, little gutters are arranged, so that at the end
of the day the overflow can be conducted there; when the bed
nearest the fountain has been saturated, the water is blocked off
from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> first trench
with a spadeful of earth, runs on to refresh the next, and so on
till all the garden has drunk its fill; when the rivulet, having
done its work, regains its liberty.</p>

</div>

<p>I had not to wander far to find a subject for painting, and lost
no time in getting to work in the lane. A bewildering number of
interesting groups kept passing; women and girls bearing pitchers,
classical-looking herdsmen, driving sheep and goats, little kids,
calves, and heifers; and husbandmen would go by with mules and
donkeys, on their way to till the land, or to hew and collect
firewood.</p>

<p>Soon the path was blocked with people declaring that I was in
everybody’s way, and that I could not remain there painting; for
the women said (so I gathered from a man who spoke a few words of
French) that they were afraid to pass, being especially alarmed at
my umbrella. This was too ridiculous; though the umbrella was
certainly large, I considered it too useful to be put on one side,
or indeed to be treated slightingly.</p>

<p>One morning, when passing through the market-place in Algiers, I
had noticed a man selling jewellery under an enormous umbrella; it
struck me that such a one would suit me exactly for painting.
Admiring its noble proportions, I went up and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_41">[41]</span> spoke to the owner, who obligingly left
his stall in charge of a friend, and introduced me to the maker. I
forthwith ordered another. It was made to take to pieces—each rib
about four feet long, and practically, it was more serviceable than
a small tent. It had a big iron spike, which could be rammed into
the ground almost anywhere; it could besides be steadied with guys;
it was large enough to shade me and my work, and it had a cover
impervious to light; moreover, I could unloop the cover from the
ends of the rods, and roll it up, so that without difficulty I
could let in light in whatever direction I pleased. I was
determined not to desert such an umbrella for all the women of
Kabylia, so I let the men talk and gesticulate, and went on
painting as if I heard them not.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw2">
<figure class="iw2" id="i07"><img src='images/i07.jpg' alt=

</div>

<p>When Muirhead returned, I beat an orderly retreat, to
‘déjeuner.’ He too had had his trials, being quite baffled by the
strong wind, which swept over the crest where Uncle Zaïd’s kouba
stands.</p>

<p>When painting under my umbrella, I found the cattle of Kabylia
even more timid than the fair sex. The cows are small but nimble,
the unusual appearance of a European is sufficient to scare them,
and the umbrella added was altogether too much for their nerves;
they would canter off gaily, to the consternation of the herdsmen,
shortly reappearing in order to eye me warily. I stood as close as
possible against the bank, keeping quiet, when suddenly there was a
rush, and the cows scampered by in wild alarm at the frightful
object. Instead of scowling and muttering curses, as I expected and
considered my due, the cowherd always stopped and greeted me in
friendly fashion, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_42">[42]</span> pressing upon me a handful of figs, as though
I had done him a favour. Perhaps he thought that friendly demeanour
made amends for the ridiculous behaviour of his animals. At first I
regretted causing all this trouble, and tried to express myself to
that effect; after a time, discovering that they did not consider
me to be a more obnoxious animal than the gadflies, which abound, I
continued to paint with equanimity, glad to be looked upon as a
natural evil.</p>

<p>After ‘déjeuner,’ two Fathers and a number of Kabyles paid us a
visit. There were complaints of our tent being pitched close to the
road where the women were obliged to pass; and words began to flow
apace.</p>

<p>The Amine of Ouarzin (or the Ogre) having given us permission to
camp there, the Ogres had nothing to say, but the people of the
larger village of Taourirt en Taïdith (the Mount of the Dog)
doggedly objected. They offered even to level a piece of ground,
and transport our tent and luggage free of expense, if we would
only move from the road. Through the good words and banter of the
Fathers, ‘the Dogs’ at last left off barking, smiles took the place
of frowns, ruffled feelings were composed, and a compromise
effected. We remained on the conditions that we would leave the
lane free between the hours of ten and four; and that we would send
a native lad to the fountain in place of Dominique, who was to go
no more at all, either to draw water or wash clothes, except at a
little-used spring pointed out; to our dismay, a mere
duckweed-covered puddle. So the storm was lulled.</p>

<p><em>Friday, April</em> 16, 1880.—I awoke, hearing the lively
chatter of women. What a chirping there was! They spoke in a very
high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> pitch of voice,
and the language, as pronounced by them, sounded very different to
that of the men. I peeped as discreetly as I could out of the tent,
and behold! the lane was thronged; there were scores of them going
to and fro, each with a pitcher on her head.</p>

<p>Alas! for the weather. The sirocco had been succeeded by a cold
wind from the north, and the air was full of fog, it rained all
day, and resembled more the climate of the Highlands of Scotland
than what we anticipated the climate of North Africa would be.</p>

<p>We occupied ourselves with letter writing, reading, and trying
to learn Kabyle, making persistent and comical attempts at
conversation with natives who came to visit us; they were most
inquisitive, but well-mannered, and anxious to talk. School hours
over, the lads came to see us, pleased to air their stock of
French, and equally eager to teach us words in Kabyle; this was
just what we wanted, and we were soon excellent friends.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, April</em> 17, 1880.—To-day proved more
spring-like. I remained unmolested in the lane, whilst Muirhead
went off to the Kouba. Uncle Zaïd always behaved to Muirhead as an
uncle should, presenting him every day with clotted milk,
hard-boiled eggs, cakes and figs; he always refused payment, shook
his head, smiled blandly, pointed upwards with his forefinger,
turned up his eyes, and ejaculated ‘Errebbi, Errebbi!’ (God, God!)
to indicate that he acted thus merely to please the Almighty; let
us hope that he behaves as well to all poor folk who cross his
picturesque hill. We retaliated by giving dinner to his son and
grandson, who came once or twice to the tent; but the little chapel
received no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> donation
from us. We continued our painting also at Thililit, and Thililit
vied with Ouarzin and Taourirt in hospitality to the stranger. The
Amine, a fine-looking man, with an agreeable countenance, offered
us a kouskous. We feared it would be hopelessly cold before
arriving at the tent; but it was so well wrapped up, that after a
mile long journey it remained hot. To-day the Kaïd, or President of
the Aïth Ménguellath, came over from Fort National on business. He
called during our absence, and left a message with Dominique, that
if the natives annoyed us, we were to complain to him. After this,
we went where we would without interference.</p>

<p class="chstart">E commenced fresh studies in a rocky ravine
beneath Thililit, where trees nodded over the steep path. These
sketches were never finished to our satisfaction, we were harassed
by the sun, and continual calls to make way for brushwood-bearing
peasants, timid cows, sheep, goats and kids. Much as I delight in
goats and kids, they are truly provoking when they roll down stones
upon one’s picture, or skip into the palette.</p>

<p>Provisions are cheap, twelve fresh eggs for nine sous, for two
sous more dried figs than can be piled in the hands. Every morning
a lad brought us a freshly-baked wheaten loaf, unleavened, in the
form of a round flat cake; we found this sweet and good, and ate it
with honey. The more general bread of the people is made of
barley-flour, but the sweet acorn of the ilex is also much used,
and the natives think this as good as barley-flour, and pay
as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> much for it. The
poor are often reduced to a dinner of herbs; everyday we saw women
washing salads; one in particular we noticed, that looked like
celery, but which really was the midrib of the leaf of a
thistle.</p>

<p>One morning a sportsman brought in a fat young boar that he had
shot in the valley beneath, we gave him ten francs for it, an
extravagant price, we learned afterwards. We presented the Fathers
with half the meat, and there remained as much as we could dispose
of. Dominique cooked well for us, but the contempt he entertained
for all things native was sometimes annoying; he professed himself
unable to swallow Kabyle bread, he said it made him ill; we always
therefore supplied him with French bread, from Fort National,
though we never ate it ourselves.</p>

<p>He is a fair specimen of a colonist, and abuses the natives in
unmeasured terms. How would the <i>colons</i> get on without <i>les
cochons d’indigènes</i>? The former exist by first getting the
Government to give them a ‘concession’ of cultivated land belonging
to the ‘indigène,’ and then employing the ex-proprietor to work for
them. The most flattering expression I ever heard a Frenchman use
towards the Kabyles was, ‘une race capable d’être assimilée.’ He
doubtless thought this praise in the highest degree; but the remark
was not altogether free from French conceit, nor true, except in
the sense that a good beefsteak is assimilated when swallowed by a
man of large appetite and strong digestion.</p>

<p>Muirhead had been expecting for some days, a visit from his
friend W. B. R———, who had been spending the winter in Algiers, and
from H. M———, on a holiday trip from Gibraltar. On April 22, the
two appeared, having come from the Fort to reconnoitre<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> before bringing their tent. They
decided to pitch alongside of us, and shortly started on their way
back.</p>

<p><em>Friday, April</em> 23, 1880.—We went to the market
Souk-el-Jemāa, the largest in the country, being held in the very
heart of Kabylia, at a point central for populous tribes; from one
spot, thirty villages can be counted on the adjacent hills. It was
an interesting walk, and there was again cause for wonder to find
gradients so steep carefully cultivated. The Kabyles</p>

<p class="nind">The ash, plentiful about the summit, is prized by
the people, not for the beauty of the trees, nor for the grateful
shade they cast over the paths, but because their leaves afford
forage during summer heats, when all herbage is parched. The boughs
are lopped to cause a number of small branches to shoot out, and
thus increase the quantity of leaves.</p>

<p>The fig plantations yield a most important harvest, dried figs
being one of the staple foods of the country. The trees were in
their most charming state, the beautiful mystery of silver-tangled
stems not obscured, but enhanced by the golden sprinkling of
opening leaves.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first-formed fruit drops off when half grown, to make place
for that which is to arrive at maturity. When at Fort National last
winter, I noticed dried figs hanging by threads from<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> the branches, I was informed
these were wild ones, and that minute insects escape, aiding the
fructification of the plants from which they are suspended; the
Kabyles count thirty-two varieties of this tree. Ilexes too were in
full flower, with green bronze-coloured tassels hanging in
profusion. Not very dissimilar in appearance were the cork trees,
sober but refined in colour, combining a certain quaintness with
elegance of form. Vines everywhere twined in great serpentine lines
amongst the foliage. Lastly, on the lower slopes were fine groves
of olive; a tree which grows with a vigour unmatched in Italy.</p>

<p>We scrambled down steep paths, and found ourselves at the foot
of the mountain; halting on a grassy slope, we heard the rush of a
torrent in its stony bed, mixed with the hum of voices of many
people, and looking over the edge of the slope, saw the market just
beneath. There, Kabyles were closely packed, like a swarm of bees,
and hundreds of white burnouses jostled among the olives. Rows of
rustic bowers were used as shops. In the centre was a fountain for
men, while the stream served for watering the animals; on its banks
flocks and herds were collected, and many animals had already been
slaughtered for the day’s consumption. In the market all the
commodities that Kabyles have need of were for sale. Here were
great piles of bowls and other utensils in wood; there all sorts of
earthenware vessels; in other quarters, burnouses and articles of
clothing, oil, figs, grain, skins, tobacco leaves, and many other
things. At every step there were varying pictures; but the heat was
great, and in spite of the interest of the scene, we were soon glad
to repose in the shade apart from the throng, where we lunched, and
I spent the rest of the day<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_49">[49]</span> painting and taking photographs. Besides
supplying ourselves with meat and necessaries, I bought a woman’s
dress of singular design, splashed in a curious way with patches of
red; I also got pieces of cowhide, which were made up next day into
sandals, which are called ercassen. The women usually do not attend
the markets; a few however can sometimes be seen in a knot by
themselves with pottery for sale.</p>

<p>As we returned the Jurjura were almost obscured in mist, a sure
sign of approaching sirocco; the paths were crowded with peasants
on their way home, in good humour, well satisfied with their day’s
bargaining.</p>

<p>Kabyle paths are abrupt and rugged in the extreme; now running
up over masses of rock, a very knife-edge of the mountain; now in
steps passing between deep banks overgrown with ferns and flowers;
one moment darkened by overhanging trees, an instant after they
open upon a grand panorama, to twist again suddenly into some
romantic bower. As we approached our tent at dusk, there by the
side of it, was a second one, an army bell-tent, our friends having
arrived during our absence.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, April</em> 24 to <em>Tuesday, May</em> 4,
1880.—These were the days that they remained with us, most
unfortunate as regards the weather, for we were often enveloped in
dense cloud, and could see nothing.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Swift gliding mists the dusky hills
invade,</div>

<div class="line indent0">To thieves more grateful than the

<div class="line indent0">Lost and confus’d amidst the thicken’d
day.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">So steamy was the air, that we hardly once saw the
summits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> the higher
mountains. A furious sirocco was succeeded by a short ominous
stillness, then a storm from the north enveloped us anew in cloud,
and opened the flood-gates of heaven to an accompaniment of thunder
and lightning; then a lull, to be followed by another storm and
mist and drizzle, till everything was saturated. During these
doubtful lulls, with breaks in the clouds as if it meant better
things, we rambled, for the sake of exercise, and to see what we
could of the country.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>More thunder-storms, more hopeful breaks, when, towards evening,
the sun would sink in golden glory beneath a troubled sea of purple
mountains, and tinge the phalanxed clouds with gorgeous
colours.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">So when thick clouds enwrap the

<div class="line indent0">O’er heaven’s expanse like one black

<div class="line indent0">Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing

<div class="line indent0">And all th’ immeasur’d ether flames with

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus would the declining sun shed rich gleams over wet grass and
dripping foliage. Near the tents, in a secluded corner, an ilex on
a knoll bent over an elegant ash, and a vine lovingly
entwined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> among their
branches, spangled with its leaves the ilex’s sombre mass as with
gems of translucent green. Hard by, a warning to the fated trees, a
huge vine ungratefully strangled with its coils the aged ash which
had for so many years supported it.</p>

<p>During these days the Kabyles came in numbers to the tents,
bringing dresses and jewellery for sale; there was lively
bargaining, and we made many purchases.</p>

<p>Before the French came, there were no cotton dresses: these have
now become common, but the native woollen cloth is still usually
worn.</p>

<p>The men’s dress consists of a woollen tunic, confined at the
waist with a belt, and a burnous; on the head is a close-fitting
skull-cap, much like those worn by monks; added to this, in the
summer time, is a plaited grass hat, very high in the crown, and
with a huge brim, which falls into picturesque lines when the hat
is old and battered; sandals complete the costume, though men often
go barefoot as well as bare-headed. They crop the hair short, for
Kabyles are not so careful about shaving as the Arabs.</p>

<p>The burnous is a white woollen cloak with a hood; it is closely
woven, is durable, and impervious to heat and cold; an admirable
piece of dress, designed with thorough good sense, and suited
perfectly to the habits and requirements of the people. Its make is
shown in the diagram, which supposes the cloak doubled and laid out
flat on the ground. It then forms a quarter of a circle, of which
the radius is the length from the neck to the ankle of the wearer,
<em>a b</em>. The width of an ample hood is added along one side,
and the hood itself forms a square in addition. The three strongly
marked lines, <span class="sc2">A</span>, <span class=
"sc2">B</span>, <span class="sc2">C</span>, show where it is
closed. At <span class="sc2">A</span>, the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_52">[52]</span> cloth is doubled, at <span class=
"sc2">B</span> and <span class="sc2">C</span> it is sewn together.
From this it will be understood that it is a garment woven all in
one piece; no stuff has to be cut off, and thus no labour is wasted
in its manufacture.</p>

<p>The tunic or shirt, if doubled and laid out in the same way,
forms simply an oblong figure, with holes for the head and arms,
and open below.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw8">
<figure class="iw8" id="i10"><img src='images/i10.jpg' alt=
'[Illustration]'>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The burnous is worn in a multitude of ways. One of the ends
hanging down in front is thrown across the breast and over the
shoulder; or both sides are shortened, by being thrown up on the
shoulders; or the cloak, suspended from one shoulder, is passed
round the back, across the breast, and tucked under the armpit.
Sometimes the hood muffles the head, sometimes it is thrown back,
or the seam beneath the chin is put back to the nape of the
neck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> while one elbow
rests in the hood, which then plays the part of a deep pocket. The
burnous may also be shortened by hitching it up under the arms, or
the corners, knotted together, are slipped up to the chin, or
arranged to come at the back of the neck. Indeed, it is twisted
about according to fancy and convenience. The Kabyles have one
dodge for tucking it up when ploughing; another for making it into
a sort of sack to carry forage. When it is hot they wear it one
way; another when it is cold. As it is impossible to follow these
arrangements by simply watching the people, I got a Kabyle to come
for an afternoon and give me a regular lesson. I took notes,
twisted a burnous about my person in every conceivable fashion, and
felt much impressed with the knottiness of the subject.</p>

<p>The dress of the women is simpler than that of the men; and
being adjusted to the wearer’s person in a definite manner, it is,
luckily for comprehension, not so confusing as the burnous.</p>

<p>These dresses are called Aabans, and are strong and warm. Some
are plain, others have ornamental borders, or broad bands of divers
colours worked in geometric patterns; others again are covered all
over with such patterns; some are red, some an indigo blue.</p>

<p>Their character and style are of great antiquity, yet no two are
quite alike; the individual workwoman, while following a tradition,
reserves liberty for her own ingenuity and taste.</p>

<p>Before long these serviceable and interesting dresses will have
disappeared, and the unfortunate women will then feel the improving
effects of modern civilisation, by having nothing to wear but
villanous coloured pocket-handkerchiefs, and chilly white
cotton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> goods. Yes,
alas! from the draperies of antiquity to dresses of Manchester
printed stuff, intended to be cut into handkerchiefs, is a too easy
and inevitable jump.</p>

<p>The dress, hanging very loosely about the arms, which are bare
for convenience, is sometimes kept closer to the figure, by a red
band which passes in a loop over each shoulder, and crosses at the
back, where it is ornamented with little red tassels. This is
called an Asfifi, and is a pretty feature. When the arms are
raised, the loose drapery hanging through the loops has much the
appearance of the full sleeve of the Italian peasant.</p>

<p>The Asfifi is interesting as explaining the origin of the corset
of the Moorish women, which at the back is only three or four
inches in depth; this is merely an Asfifi solidified. The tiny
Moorish corset, but little enlarged, was to be found in the old
costume of Capri, Procida, and Ischia, in which the corset only
reached about half way to the waist.</p>

<p>Shoulder-pins, called Ifizimen, are made of silver, often
enriched with coral and enamels, the fastening is just an Irish
brooch; they have in addition, triangular ornamented plates of
metal attached to the lower end of the fastening. These pins are
sometimes connected with a chain, to the centre of which is
suspended a little metal box, enamelled, and containing scent.</p>

<p>The girdle, which is called an Argooz, effective in appearance,
consists of a quantity of woollen plaits, the prevailing hue red,
bound together at points about eighteen inches apart, with cross
bindings of bright colours. These ties are sometimes of silk, and
the girdles are from fifteen to twenty feet in length.</p>

<p>On the head is worn a little peaked bonnet, like the French
cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> of liberty. This
is called a Timhárent. It is made by doubling in half, lengthway, a
broad silk band, and sewing up one side. It is kept in its place by
a second kerchief, bound round, and knotted behind. These silk
Timhárents come from Tunis. Many women allow their hair to wave
free, or confine it simply with a fillet.</p>

<p>A frequent ornament is a round silver brooch called a
‘Táfizimth,’ with an opening in the centre crossed by a pin. Bosses
of coral, as well as knobs of silver, which latter have a very
pearl-like effect, are dotted about it. These are effective pieces
of jewellery, and with the sun shining on them, they glisten like
moons. They are not adopted till a woman becomes a mother. On the
birth of a girl the Táfizimth is worn between the breasts; on the
birth of a boy, it is raised, and gleams above the forehead.
Remarking that many of these brooches offered for sale, were
damaged, a Kabyle gave a frank explanation which was: ‘When a man’s
wife was disobedient, and got beaten, her custom was to undo the
“Táfizimth” and dash it to the ground at his feet.’</p>

<p>There is another head-ornament, handsomer than this. It is
called a ‘Taasubth,’ and consists of a central silver brooch over
the forehead, and side brooches above the temples, enriched in the
same style, and with rows of silver gleaming semispheres completely
encircling the head, and forms a glittering tiara fit for a
princess. The ‘repoussé’ semispheres are about three-quarters of an
inch in diameter. I have seen this same ornament in Pompeian
jewellery.</p>

<p>Bracelets of ‘repoussé’ work, and sometimes silver anklets, are
worn. Necklaces are made of beads and coral, and also of cloves and
sweet-smelling paste, but a handsomer and more
characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> sort,
called a ‘Theslegth,’ is a row of square silver boxes, containing
scents, strung together with pieces of coral.</p>

<p>During the wet weather, I had plenty of time to study my Kabyle
Dictionary and Grammar; the school children also came and gave help
in learning the language; and as Kabyles sat in the tent nearly all
day, I had constant opportunities for trying to speak it, and made
progress. Our friends brought a servant rejoicing in the name of
Zachariah, who spoke Arabic; this was of service, and we called
upon him for help, when mutual ignorance brought conversation to a
dead-lock, as it often did. The Kabyles are such travellers that in
every village some speak Arabic; but there is not a woman in the
country who understands anything but Kabyle.</p>

<p>Zachariah was of a cheerful disposition, and made company for
the melancholy Dominique, who however did not grow more lively in
consequence. The latter used to lecture Zachariah, and give him the
advantages of his experience, describe mysterious and savoury
dishes that he had concocted in cities, and recount the perils to
be endured by colonists living amongst Arabs in the interior. His
chief complaint against Zachariah was, ‘Ce pauvre jeune homme ne
sait pas beaucoup, cependant il ne demande pas de conseil.’ Those
were trying days for both men, when they had to cook in the pouring
rain. Dominique also was extremely disgusted at the freedom with
which we let natives sit in the entrance to our tent; he
periodically rushed in a perfect frenzy of rage, at the boys who
chaffed him, and ‘Dominique Marboul’ (Mad Dominique) became a
familiar expression in our ears.</p>

<p>One morning some Kabyles brought two very young boars
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> the tents, little
brown and yellow striped creatures. Zachariah, taking a fancy to
these genuine ‘cochons sauvages,’ bought them for pets. Little
boars, as they grow up, are said to become much attached to their
masters, nothing delighting them more than to follow their
benefactors incessantly, and by rubbing against their legs,
demonstrate their gratitude and affection. One of these dear
creatures was put out to nurse, given into the charge of a Kabyle
lad to rear, Zachariah undertaking to look after the other himself.
Part of our tent was partitioned off into a room for Dominique.
Zachariah slept there also; and he hid away his pet in the corner,
while Dominique sat opposite, predicting evil for it. The pig had
naturally no intention of remaining in one particular spot; and on
finding itself alone, went squeaking all about the place, feebly
enough, for it was weak and soon grew weaker. On the second day it
was ‘in extremis,’ with a pinched-up look about the body.
Zachariah, anxious about the brother out at nurse, had it brought
back and set by the fire for warmth. He was called away, and
meanwhile the little beast, shivering, toppled into the glowing
embers and was roasted. This tragedy was quickly followed by the
death of the surviving pig. During the night, while nursed in
Zachariah’s bosom, with a few faint squeaks, it closed its brief
and chastened existence.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, May</em> 4, 1880.—H. M.’s leave of absence drew
towards a close. He and his comrade could no longer remain, and we
were obliged to part with their pleasant company. The mules were
laden, and we bade our friends ‘bon voyage.’</p>

<p>The trees were now in fulness of summer leaf, but in spite
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> the rich and rapid
growth of all vegetation, owing to the wet, there was not that

<p class="chstart">HE abnormal amount of wet delighted the Kabyles,
for they knew it meant heavy crops; and they had suffered from
droughty seasons, so that the olive harvest of the previous autumn
had been an entire failure. However it was most annoying to us.
What had happened? What had we done to deserve this? We began to

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Weather permitting
we painted, and as our days much repeated each other, I shall not
attempt to follow them regularly, but make desultory remarks upon
such things as struck me. One day we went to a neighbouring market,
Souk-es-Sebt; Saturday’s market. Unlike Souk-el-Jemāa, this is held
at the top of a bare mountain. In clear weather this point must
command a magnificent view; it was very fine with the Jurjura
wreathed in clouds. I have given an illustration of men at a market
selling fig-cuttings.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent14">Some in deep mould</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">These fig-cuttings look like unpromising bundles of
dry sticks; but ‘as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the
garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth,’
even so may the people ‘put on the garment of praise for the spirit
of heaviness.’</p>

<p>Not till we arrived at the market did we perceive the reason for
its being held at such an inconvenient and exposed spot; we then
saw a number of villages before us, perched on the crests of
precipitous ridges.</p>

<p>The market is on the boundary between the Aïth Ménguellath and a
tribe called the Aïth or Beni Yahïa. Beni is the Arabic for ‘sons
of,’ the word Aït or Aïth has the same meaning in Kabyle. The
locality of markets is often on the boundary of tribal territories,
such as Souk-es-Sebt and Souk-el-Jemāa. Souk-el-Arba at Fort
National, on the contrary, is in the centre of the tribe Beni
Iraten.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw2">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Such points of
junction were esteemed neutral in old days, when the country was
disturbed, and tribesmen could attend and transact business in
safety when it would have been dangerous to overstep the limits of
their own lands.</p>

<p>An institution that rendered travelling in safety possible when
the country was embroiled, is that called Anaya, which is a
reciprocal compact between two persons to guard each other from
attack. A traveller wishing to pass through antagonistic tribes, or
for any reason apprehending danger, sought a friend, who granted
him Anaya; this friend, if he did not accompany him gave some
token, to be presented in the tribe whither the stranger was going,
which would ensure the respect and hospitality due to himself; the
new host would in his turn offer the stranger Anaya, and so pass
him on in safety. Since the French have introduced settled
government, this custom has disappeared, or more truly speaking,
lies dormant, for I have myself met a Frenchman who assured me that
his life was saved by it in 1870. When the revolt broke out, he was
far away from home, but a native friend accorded him Anaya, and by
means of tokens, he was passed in safety to a French settlement,
though the country was in a flame.</p>

<p>A woman could give Anaya in the absence of her husband; it was
in consequence of its violation, that a war occurred in which
several tribes took part. It was ‘à propos’ of this same affair,
that the villages beneath which we were encamped received the names
of ‘Taourirt en Taïdith’ (The Peak of the Dog) and ‘Ouarzen’ (the
Ogre). The following is the story: A man of the Aïth Bou Yousef,
desiring to pass through the territory of the Aïth Ménguellath, but
fearing to fall a victim to the vengeance of an enemy,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> presented himself at a house in
Taourirt, and solicited Anaya. His friend being absent, the wife
gave him as token a dog, well known about there as belonging to her
husband. Shortly after, the woman saw her dog return alone, covered
with blood. Not knowing what to think, she called friends together,
who starting in quest of the stranger, soon discovered his body
disfigured with wounds, lying at the bottom of a ravine.
Indignation was felt at this perfidious act; two parties were
formed, and no terms of accommodation being arrived at, fighting
began.</p>

<p>The French first dominated this part of the country by marching
a column to Souk-es-Sebt, in 1854. The Aïth Ménguellath finding
themselves threatened, tendered submission; three years later, in
conjunction with other tribes, they rose in arms. They were then
attacked by General Macmahon, who carried their villages by storm,
and consigned them as a prey to the flames.</p>

<p>The tribe of the Beni Yahïa was in former days the nucleus of a
Kabyle state known to Spanish writers as Cuco, which was also the
name of their chief town. It corresponds with the confederation of
the Zouáoua. The outlet of the country was by the roadstead of
Azefoun, where commerce was transacted with the Marseillese.
Marmol, who wrote <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1573, gives an
account of the country which answers to its present condition; and
he speaks of the warlike inhabitants, who recognised no master, and
paid tribute to none. They were rich in corn, in flocks, and
horses, and though constantly fighting, they had free markets on
neutral ground, where hostile tribes could do business without
fear.</p>

<p>History does not deign to speak much about the Kabyles. These
mountaineers appear to have remained generally
untouched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> by the
political movements that distracted North Africa. A little book by
A. Berbrugger, ‘Les Epoques Militaires de la Grande Kabylie,’
published 1857, enters into details of their history, though the
author has difficulty to find continuous firm ground for his
statements. What he makes evident is, the unchanging character of
the people, their troublesome and dangerous qualities as
neighbours, and the pertinacity with which they were always ready
to fight for their independence.</p>

<p>Ebn Khaldoun, himself a Berber, and the historian of the race,
wrote towards the end of the fourteenth century. He speaks of the
confederation of the Zouáoua, and gives the names of tribes, many
of which still exist. It is to the Zouáoua that the word Zouave
owes its origin. The Kabyles were then less exclusively confined to
the mountains, and many led a nomadic life in the adjoining plains.
They were dressed in striped garments, one end of which thrown over
the shoulder, floated behind, they also had heavy burnouses, black,
and of a tawny brown colour, and went generally bareheaded, only
shaving from time to time.</p>

<p>One day, in the Aïth Ménguellath, I met an old man with a
burnous striped all over with thin dark lines of blue, and further
ornamented with chess-board patterns; this I bought off his back,
as it was the only thing of the sort I had seen in the country. As
the ends of the burnous are commonly flung over the shoulder, I
conclude that the striped garments mentioned by Ibn Khaldoun were
of this nature; though possibly he refers to striped cloths such as
are still worn by the women.</p>

<p>Throughout the long dominion of the Romans, the Berbers were
continually breaking the peace, and were rather hemmed
in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> and overawed,
than assimilated to the higher civilisation surrounding them.</p>

<p>In those times they were known under the name of the
Quinquegentians, or five tribes, and various proofs can be brought
to show that they were of a very refractory character. For instance
a Roman inscription preserved at Aumale, runs to this effect: ‘To
Q. Gargilius, victim of the attacks of the Bavars, on account of
the love he bore the citizens, and his single-minded affection for
his country, and besides, on account of his courage and vigilance
in taking and killing the rebel Faraxen with his partisans, the
municipal body of Auzia, at its own cost, has raised and dedicated
this monument, 24 March 221 of the province.’ Or 261 <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The word Faraxen is supposed to apply to the leader of the Beni
Fraousen, one of the present principal tribes.</p>

<p>The war of Firmus, an account of which is given by Gibbon, took
place in these regions. An outline of the revolt in a few words, is
this: The Roman governor of Africa, Count Romanus, instead of
protecting the colonists against the inroads of the tribes, sought
only by unjust oppressive measures to benefit his own pocket, and
having powerful friends at court, he was able to hide his
iniquitous proceedings from the Emperor. At this time Nubal was
chief of the Zouáoua. He had many sons, some natural, some
legitimate. Zammer, a natural son and friend of the governor, was
killed in a dispute by a legitimate son, Firmus. He, in order to
avoid threatened punishment, revolted, and the rising became
formidable on account of the disordered state of the province. This
was about <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 370. To quell the
rebellion, Count Theodosius was sent over to Africa, he landed at
the modern Gigelli, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> proceeded to Setif, and shortly advanced with
an army to Tribusuptus, the present Bordj Tiklat, some twenty miles
from Bougie, where Roman ruins exist in abundance. From this point
he proceeded to attack the Quinquegentians. The names of the tribes
mentioned are the Tindenses, Massinissenses, Isaflenses, Jubaleni,
and Jesaleni. The Massinissenses are still to be recognised under
the name of the Imsissen; Massen Issa, meaning the sons of Aïssa;
the Isaflenses are the Iflissen; the Jubaleni appear to be the
mountaineers of the Jurjura, for the Romans were checked in their
attack on them, on account of the difficult nature of the
country.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The war, after continuing for some time, was brought to a close
by the Kabyle chief Firmus destroying himself, to avoid being given
up by Igmazen, the chief of the Isaflenses, to the victorious
Romans. The principal interest of the story of the war is, that it
shows the possibility of tracing certain tribes up to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> this remote period; it proves
also to what an extent they were independent, and on what turbulent
terms they lived with their neighbours; a state of things which
continued till they were conquered by the French.</p>

<p>The Romans on going to North Africa, found native Berber
kingdoms, Numidia, Mauretania, Gætulia, Lybia. The inhabitants of
these kingdoms were all of one race, and spoke dialects of the same
language, usually known as Berber, but the native name for it is
Tamazirght or Amazirgh.</p>

<p>In all the more inaccessible places of North Africa their direct
descendants are to be found; they speak varieties of the old
language, and have the same character and institutions.<a id=
"FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Berber belongs to a class of languages named Hamitic, which
comprises ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian languages. An
obvious peculiarity which strikes an Englishman, is the prevalence
of Th sounds, both hard and soft, as in the English words ‘the’ and
‘thin.’ T is often softened into Th, and S into Z. But natives of
the same village do not always pronounce words alike. For instance,
one would say Aït Ménguellat, another the Aïth Ménguellath. Other
peculiarities there are, upon which I need hardly enter.</p>

<p>Those who have not tried the experiment, can hardly be aware of
the difficulty of writing down the speech of an illiterate peasant,
in which sounds recur which do not exist in European language. It
would require an intimate knowledge of the various sections of the
Berber race, to have a just appreciation of their
language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> classified
as Morocco Berber, called Shilha, or Tamazirght, descended from
ancient Mauretanian; Berber of the Jurjura and Aures mountains, or
Kabyle, descended from ancient Numidian; Touareg from ancient
Gætulian; and Ghadames from ancient Garamantian.</p>

<p>The number of localities in Kabylia where traces of the Romans
have been found, are too numerous to mention. On the coast were the
towns of Saldæ, the modern Bougie; Rusuccurum, now Dellys; and
Rusazus, now Azeffoun. There are ruins of importance at Taksebt on
Cape Tedles, and at Jemāa-es-Sahridj, a central point in the tribe
of the Beni Fraousen. This latter spot I visited in 1873. Its site
is beautiful, and celebrated for abundance of springs. I have a
pleasant recollection of the songs of nightingales among shady
groves, and of the courteous manners of the rural chief, who was
entertaining his friends beneath a cane-trellised arbour; but I
cannot say I was much impressed by the antiquities, which consist
chiefly of rubble walls on the top of a hill. In the market-place
are blocks of masonry, supposed to be the remains of a Roman bath.
It is obvious to the most uninitiated in military matters, that a
station here must have blocked the natural outlet from the higher
mountains towards the sea. Since my visit, a flourishing school has
sprung up under the superintendence of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>The Kabyles, engaged in internal disputes and struggles to
maintain their independence, having their simple wants satisfied by
rude manufactures and the land they tilled, never had intercourse
with nations more advanced than themselves, and felt not their own
deficiencies. Every man guarded above all things his
individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> liberty,
with a jealousy that prevented him combining with others to carry
out any works of importance, and none had the capital which might
have induced the many to labour for an end in common; the only
sentiment of sufficient strength to bind them together was fear of
the invader. From time immemorial Kabylia has been the home of
peasant proprietorship, of communism, of local self-government with
popular assemblies, of social equality; but owing to the limited
resources of the country, to the crude notion that the people have
of liberty, and to an excess of the democratic spirit, their
civilisation has crystallised in a primitive form.</p>

<p>The French have now changed all this, and hold the country with
a firm hand. But in 1870 they were obliged to withdraw from Algeria
most of their troops in order to fight the Germans.</p>

<p>Incited by ill-judging men, the native tribes unhappily thought
the moment to strike for independence had come; they rose, and
committed barbarous and frightful excesses; though, to be just
towards them, the cruelties they had themselves suffered from must
be borne in mind. The Franco-German war over, the troops returned
and put down the revolt. The French, full of the bitterest
feelings, confiscated the rich wheat-growing lands, and imposed a
crushing war tribute, that it took the Kabyles five years to pay.
Complete disarmament was also effected, and the country became for
the first time safe. Fort Napoleon sustained a long siege without
being the worse for it, and changed its name to Fort National, with
this new era of ‘Liberté, Égalité, et Fraternité.’</p>

<p>It was defended by native troops, who thus proved their fidelity
under the most painful circumstances. Great numbers of
Kabyles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> have been
ruined, and forced to gain their bread by working for the French,
and many disgusted with the state of things, have fled to enjoy the
license of the native province of Tunis, in districts remote from
the hated foreigner.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A knowledge of French is essential for natives who desire to
gain a livelihood by working for Europeans, and likewise in the
settlement of disputes, which otherwise are fostered by
go-betweens, who thrive on the ignorant by pretending to advance
their interests with those who govern. It is specially to this work
of education that the missionary Fathers apply themselves.
They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> are a society
recognised by the State, on the understanding that they do not
interfere with the religion of the people. There is besides, little
temptation for them to do so, as the jealousy of the natives would
be aroused, and their influence with them consequently lost. Truly
it would be foolish to cherish fallacious hopes of converting the
Kabyles; they respect the sincerity of the Fathers, but there are
too many nominal Christians in the land, who, the natives remark,
do not believe in their own Marabouts.</p>

<p>The Fathers are the only Europeans that the natives think
disinterested friends; the single-minded devotion with which they
give themselves to a useful and philanthropic mission, causes them
to be universally honoured. An extensive field lies open; so much
so, that one is struck by the disproportion between means and aims;
they are a forlorn hope of Christian knights valiantly assaulting
the stronghold of ignorance; men doing battle on the summit of a
scaling ladder, without sympathy given by the army encamped at a
distance. Until these schools were founded, the natives picked up
French under difficulties. The following translation of a song,
will give the reader their sentiments concerning their study of the
language:</p>

<p>One lovely day, bright and cloudless, on approaching the
cemetery of Thililit, we heard the chanting of many voices. There
was a funeral. The corpse, wrapped closely round in a white sheet
and carried on a stretcher, was laid on the ground; a Kabyle sat
beside and led the chant, while the friends of the dead man, in
picturesque groups, stood round the grave; one carried a crown of
oleander. The body was lowered, the earth filled in, and flagstones
fastened down on the top; there was another chant, and then the
people dispersed. The cattle, sheep, and goats grazed unconcernedly
around; the pastoral pipe but halted an hour in its soft-toned
warblings. When it recommenced, it might perchance have mourned the
loss of a brother piper, in the fashion of antique measures:</p>

<p>‘The fountain nymphs through the wood mourn for thee, and their
tears become waters; and echo amid the rocks laments, because thou
art mute, and mimics no more thy lips; and at thy death, the trees
have cast off their fruit, and the flowers have all withered; good
milk hath not flowed from ewes, nor honey from hives, but it has
perished in the wax, wasted with grief; for no longer is it meet,
now that thy honey is lost, to gather that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>The long line of
mourners issuing from the cemetery was a beautiful spectacle;
golden reflections in shadowed burnouses harmonising charmingly
with the lichened tombstones. A youth only remained behind, the son
of the deceased; he sat upon the tomb wailing.</p>

<p>I have sometimes seen locks of hair laid upon graves, reminding
of similar Greek offerings.</p>

<p>In the play of ‘Electra,’ Orestes says:—</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent10">first honouring my father’s grave,</div>

<div class="line indent0">As the god bade us, with libations pure

</div>
</div>

<p>Electra at her father’s tomb says to her sister:</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">

<div class="group">
<div class="line indent20">And then do thou,</div>

<div class="line indent0">Cutting the highest locks that crown thy

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first discovered traces of the return of Orestes are
offerings laid on their father’s tomb.</p>

<p>Chrysosthemis, the younger sister, says:—</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">

<div class="line indent0">I saw upon the topmost point of all</div>

<div class="line indent0">A tress of hair, fresh severed from the

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On a previous visit to Kabylia, when living at a farmhouse in
part of which resided a native family, I one morning heard
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> lamentable cry, and
running out, I, unperceived, observed what passed. A man sat
crouched upon a stone, with burnous flung about him, and hands
pressed against his bent-down head; his attitude was precisely that
of mourning figures I have seen painted on Greek vases.</p>

<p>At his side stood a woman swaying backwards and forwards, with
face raised as if questioning that stainless sky which seemed to
mock her with its deep serenity, with wearisome iteration uttering
the same piteous lament. She held her arms stretched upwards, and
ever and anon her clenched fists descended with merciless blows
upon her breasts. A boy, their first-born, had just fallen down
dead in a fit. The parents rushed out of the house into the fields,
and in this unaffected manner they showed their anguish. The image
of that poor woman will ever remain graven in my memory, a picture
of dire and bitter lamentation. What passionate gestures were
these! How human! But how un-English! This vehemence, this
spreading forth of hands when there was none to comfort, recalled
Biblical wailings.</p>

<p>‘Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,
but there is no judgment. He hath fenced up my way that I cannot
pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. He hath stripped me of
my glory, and taken the crown from my head. He hath destroyed me on
every side, and I am gone: and my hope hath he removed like a
tree.’</p>

<p>The day after the funeral at Thililit, we returned to the same
place and found two big vultures promenading slowly backwards and
forwards over the fresh grave; they remained there the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> greater part of the afternoon.
What mysterious faculties have these birds, both of wing and scent.
At Souk-el-Jemāa, we saw a flock of thirty or forty, sitting on the
refuse of the slaughtered animals, whilst the market was still
crowded, and we approached within twenty paces without disturbing
their repast. There must be a great number in the high mountains,
for some are usually in sight. When painting, I have heard a
rushing noise overhead, have looked up, and seen one of these great
birds sweeping swiftly along without moving a feather. Thus they
wing their flight, soaring in any direction to a prodigious
distance, performing this feat apparently by a mere effort of the
will. The power this bird possesses of discovering its prey is
attributed in the Book of Job to keenness of vision.</p>

<p>‘There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s
eye hath not seen.’</p>

<p>‘Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
understanding? Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and
kept close from the fowls of the air.’</p>

<p>Eagles also are common, some of great size.</p>

<p>One day last winter an eagle pounced on a chicken that was
unconcernedly pecking about in front of a cottage in Taourirt
Amokran. For an instant the bird remained half stunned by its rapid
descent, and a Kabyle sitting in the doorway, threw his burnous and
caught it alive. They are not birds to be trifled with, and I was
told how, on another occasion, a Kabyle following a badly wounded
eagle, was attacked by the bird, which struck at his head, clawed
out one of his eyes, and would have killed him, had not a friend
come to his assistance. Neither of us had provided<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> ourselves with guns, and our
encampment would not have been well chosen for sport. The natives
kill a few wild boars in the ravines, hares, partridges and quail;
it was the closed season, but they bagged partridges nevertheless,
going out with a call-bird to attract others. Quails are left
almost unmolested on account of their nests being in the midst of
the ripening corn. We continually heard their liquid note of
contentment, for contented they no doubt were, living unharassed in
the midst of such abundance.</p>

<p>A sportsman brought some birds of fine plumage, which I skinned;
but having only salt to cure them with, the ants got at them, and
few remained of any value.</p>

<p>The hoopoo is common; we often heard its thrice-repeated
flutelike note, or saw it with crest proudly erect, perched on the
topmost branch of a tree. A young one was brought us which we
thought of rearing, an odd little bird, always looking as if going
to topple over; it had no tail, and the crest and long bill looked
out of all proportion; it perhaps resented being laughed at, for it
had a furious temper, which we knew not how to conciliate; and when
the little creature was discovered one morning to be missing, it
was not followed by many regrets. The golden oriole is not
uncommon. Other birds more familiar were not wanting; frequently we
heard the home-reminding notes of the cuckoo; and swallows flitted
about all day. At dinner-time they would perch on a figtree within
six feet of us, gently chatter, skim through the air, and return to
chatter again.</p>

<p>Of butterflies I noticed none that are not native to England;
but I found a curious insect, simulating exactly a decaying leaf
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> evergreen oak;
under the microscope it has the appearance of being covered with
crystallised spikes.</p>

<p>When it became hot, ants were busy in every direction; one sort,
with a big red head half as large again as its black body, was
remarkable for long legs, it ran more quickly that any other ant I
ever saw; there were lots of these always in a hurry. I noticed one
enter a nest of small black ants, and afterwards reappear without
commotion ensuing; probably a hot-headed freak of curiosity. If I
were to bolt into the houses of the Kabyles in that manner, thought
I, I should meet with a very different reception.</p>

<p>Several times I saw swarms of wild bees. I have seen the boys,
who were quick in detecting the approaching hum, spring to their
feet and rush off in wild excitement, I knew not at first why. They
tried to change the course of the swarm by throwing dust into the
air; it was a pretty sight—eager boys with draperies tossed and
flying about, and an afternoon sun lighting up the handfuls of dust
and the swarming bees.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Thus in the season of unclouded
spring,</div>

<div class="line indent0">To war they follow their undaunted
king,</div>

<div class="line indent0">Crowd through their gates, and in the

<div class="line indent0">The shocking squadrons meet in mortal

<div class="line indent20">(. . .) this deadly fray</div>

<div class="line indent0">A cast of scatter’d dust will soon
allay,</div>

<div class="line indent0">And undecided leave the fortunes of the
day.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On this occasion the scattered dust had no effect, for the
winged army poured on.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Dusky they spread a close-embodied
crowd,</div>

<div class="line indent0">And o’er the vale descends the living

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another evening, two lads returning home with our
painting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> traps
suddenly put down their loads. One of them, Kassi, troubled with
great animal spirits, always up to mischief, made passes with a
stick at a bush by the wayside, protecting himself by throwing his
burnous about his head. We found him in great excitement, thrusting
at a wasp’s nest hanging in the bush. It reminded me of another of
Homer’s similes in the ‘Iliad.’</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">As wasps, provok’d by children in their
play,</div>

<div class="line indent0">Pour from their mansions by the broad

<div class="line indent0">In swarms the guiltless traveller

<div class="line indent0">Assert their waxen domes, and buzzing

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this case the guiltless travellers remained unstung, and
Kassi was called off before he learnt that the wasps could fight
like Greeks; for Homer says again:</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent4">When wasps from hollow crannies

<div class="line indent0">A race determined that to death

<div class="line indent0">So fierce these Greeks their last

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And again—</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent2">So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all

<div class="line indent0">Repuls’d in vain, and thirsty still of

<div class="line indent0">Bold son of air and heat, on angry

</div>
</div>

<p>Formidable wild animals are rare, but are still to be found in
fastnesses where wild boar offer means of subsistence; they are
occasionally driven abroad from their lairs into populated parts,
by winter’s severity. Then the unhorned tenants of the wood,
sorely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> grinding their
teeth, roam the thickets; ‘then truly are they like unto a man that
goes on a stick, whose back is well-nigh broken, and head looks
towards the ground; like such an one they roam, shunning the white
snow.’</p>

<p>Last winter there was an unusually heavy fall of snow, covering
Kabylia with a coat more than a foot thick; it still whitened all
northern slopes and blocked the passes, when I visited the country
six weeks later. I was told that the roar of a lion had been heard
shortly before, in a ravine of the Aïth Ménguellath; this may
possibly be true: the Fathers told us that they heard the laugh of
the hyena.</p>

<p>Returning last winter to Algiers, whilst passing through the
village of Tizi-Ouzou, a dead panther was brought in, shot by a
native beside a stream ten miles off, in a populous district
separated from the Jurjura by a broad valley; and a little later a
second was killed in the same neighbourhood. Curiously, when I was
at Tizi-Ouzou before, the same incident occurred; the panther had
then been shot in the forests in the direction of Bougie. The only
wild animals we came across while camping were jackals, which are
numerous; on fine nights we heard their wild empty-stomached howls,
when they prowled up from the valleys, and all the dogs in the
villages would begin barking. These were the only discordant noises
at night; more pleasant was the constant sound of distant frogs
croaking in damp places, the welcome melody of nightingales, and
the melancholy note of a bird called the Taab, which I believe to
be some kind of owl.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">And owls that mark the setting sun,
declare</div>

<div class="line indent0">A star-light evening and a morning
fair.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>That
solitary mysterious note, hardly uttered before answered in another
quarter by some brother, suggested how, when rude settlements
dreaded night attacks, the owl, harmless towards men, might from
its sleepless vigilance have been chosen to symbolise a protecting
goddess of wisdom.</p>

<p>We heard also little animals pattering over the tent in the
dark, sometimes rustling the papers under our beds. Thinking of
field-mice as likely to make these sounds, we sent for a trap; we
caught a few only, and ultimately discovered that the noise was
caused by harmless green lizards. I was not aware that these
creatures run about in the dark; they must have singular eyes, for
animals that are active by night do not usually dart about in the
brilliancy and heat of noonday.</p>

<p><em>May</em> 21 to <em>June</em> 14, 1880.—The wet season came
at last to a close, and we were favoured with the most perfect
weather imaginable. The heat was by no means oppressive, and the
air was bracing and life-giving, the sky was of exquisite colour,
and the light so intense that the tops of the trees seemed frosted
with silvery flashing lights. All snow had disappeared from the
high mountains, except here and there a minute patch; a pale
apple-green played on their slopes mixed with delicate rosy grey
tones, a mass of subtle glowing tints softened by the purple bloom
of distance. The azure of the sky appeared to soak into the
landscape and blend with the flesh-tint of the distant soil. Fallow
fields, as if stirred by a secret spirit of joy they could no
longer restrain, brought forth a multitude of wild flowers, whilst
the corn turned by degrees from green to gold. The natives changed
their hours for going a-field, becoming more matinal. On the first
signs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> approaching
dawn, the birds broke out in a concert of melody; this was followed
by the pleasant chattering of the women going to draw water. When
the sun rose and ‘tipped the hills with gold,’ the men appeared
with their flocks.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Haste, to the stream direct thy

<p class="nind">Between ten and eleven they drove them home again;
then they dined and reposed themselves, while the beasts were kept
in the cool. After three o’clock men were again abroad, till
deepening twilight ushered in the night, when lanes were crowded
with flocks, herds, and tired peasants slowly mounting homewards.
Except during these hours we saw few people, and felt at last like
mariners stranded on a forsaken shore. This was because most of the
male population betook themselves to the plains about Algiers and
Constantine in quest of employment, as it was a time of year when
extra hands were required for harvesting; on their return with a
small store of hardly-earned money, as soon as the harvest of their
own fields has been garnered, then is the season for feasts and
marriages.</p>

<p>The effects at sunset were magical: the mountains would turn to
warm violet and gold, set off by the greens and purples of nearer
ranges. The sky was of a mellow Claude-like serenity, and as the
sun sank rocks and trees glowed with a more than Venetian warmth of
colour. It was curious to observe how differently trees took the
light. Ash seemed to grow greener, whilst ilexes and corks lost
their green altogether and appeared of a rich glowing bronze. We
were not without good intentions of trying to represent<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> this; but whenever the
looked-for moment came, and splendours deepened about us, we put
aside brushes with feelings of despair.</p>

<p>At this hour there was no fear of chill or fever, for the warm
air in the confined valleys rose gradually.</p>

<p>Among the studies we painted in these days was one of the
fountain; we had anticipated remonstrance, but none was made.</p>

<p>One day a party of men begged us not to go painting there, as a
ceremony was about to be held, nor were the women allowed to draw
water after their early morning visit. At mid-day sheep were
slaughtered and cut up under the shade of the trees, the meat
carried to the villages, and the greater part, I understood, was
given away to the poor. The richer men had contributed the animals;
the chief Marabout also assisted at the slaughter. After this some
slight repairs were effected, stones that formed a rude paving in
front of the fountain were relaid, and weeds growing too
luxuriantly were pulled up.</p>

<p>I did not hear of this custom in other tribes, and I could not
understand what ideas they associated with it. It must not be
confounded with the great Mahommedan festival that occurs later,
when there is a general slaughtering of sheep, so that everyone can
eat mutton. It looks like a relic of Pagan sacrifice, which may
well be, in a country so unchanging. Have not the women from time
immemorial carried their pitchers to the fountains just as they do
now? An early Greek vase in the British Museum represents women
carrying vases in the same way I saw here. When the pitcher is
empty and more difficult to balance, it is laid on its
side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> upon a kerchief
wound into a circle and placed on the head; the mouth of the vase
projects in front; one handle kept lower than the other rests on
the edge of the twisted kerchief, and helps to steady the vase; an
arm raised to it is therefore bent. When the vase is filled and
poised on the head, both handles are at a convenient height to be
grasped when the arms are at full stretch.</p>

<p>The most interesting relic of ancient custom that I have met
with in the country, was at a marriage festival at Aïn Soltān in
the neighbourhood of Borj Boghni.</p>

<p>The bridegroom had gone to fetch his bride, and I waited with
many others beside a stream that passed at the foot of the village,
for his return. Suddenly we heard the sound of pipes, and saw the
marriage procession streaming from the summit of a neighbouring
hill, and then lose itself among the trees; a few minutes later it
issued from an avenue near us, and ascended a slope towards the
bridegroom’s house. First came the pipers, then the bride muffled
up in a veil, riding a mule led by her lover. As well as I could
judge, she was very young, almost a child. Then came a bevy of
gorgeously dressed damsels, sparkling with silver ornaments,
followed by a crowd of other friends, and Kabyle Dick and Harry. In
front of the bridegroom’s house the procession stopped; the girl’s
friends lined both sides of the pathway and crowded about the door.
The pipers marched off on one side, while the bridegroom lifted the
girl from the mule and held her in his arms. The girl’s friends
thereupon threw earth at him, when he hurried forward, and carried
her over the threshold, those about the door beating him all the
time with olive branches amid much laughter. This throwing of
earth, this mock opposition and good-natured<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_83">[83]</span> scourging, appeared to be a symbolised
relic of marriage by capture, and was a living explanation of the
ancient Roman custom of carrying the bride over the threshold of
her lover’s house.</p>

</div>

<p>In the evening on such occasions the pipers and drummers are
called in, and the women dance, two at a time, facing each other;
nor does a couple desist until, panting and exhausted, they step
aside to make room for another. The dance has great energy of
movement, though the steps are small and changes of position
slight, the dancers only circling round occasionally. But they
swing their bodies about with an astonishing energy and suppleness.
As leaves flutter before the gale, so do they vibrate to the music;
they shake, they shiver and tremble, they extend quivering arms,
wave veils, which they sometimes cast over their heads thrown
backwards like Bacchantes, and their minds seem lost in the
<em>‘abandon’</em> and frenzy of the dance, while the other women
looking on, encourage by their high piercing trilling cries, which
add to the noise of the pipes and drums. They also deride the men
by clapping their hands to the music and singing verses such as the
following:—</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Even
amidst the pomp and splendour of imperial Rome, marriage festivals
must have presented some curious resemblances to such primitive
customs as I have described, doubtless owing to unrecorded common
causes in the remote past.</p>

<p>The bride was brought home in procession, accompanied by the
singing of a song and playing on the flute; she was carried over
the threshold, and in the evening there was a marriage feast. This
habit of carrying the bride was accounted for in various ways.</p>

<p>‘Concerning the bride they do not allow her to step over the
threshold of the house, but people sent forward carry her over,
perhaps because they in old time seized upon women and compelled
them in this manner.’<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Another explanation, and I think a far less probable one, is
that she thus avoided the chance of tripping at the threshold,
which would have been considered an omen of bad fortune. To most
people it would appear a sufficiently bad augury if she required
help at such a moment to prevent her stumbling. Why should she
stumble? ‘Carefully raise over the threshold thy feet, O bride!
Without tripping begin this path, in order that for thy husband
thou mayest always be secure.’</p>

</div>

<p>In early times, the marriage banquet was not a mere matter of
ceremony. It was desirable to have as many witnesses as possible,
and such were the guests. At Greek marriages there was likewise a
procession with song and flute accompaniment, a feast in the
evening, and songs and dance before the nuptial chamber.</p>

<p>Theocritus in his ‘Epithalamium of Helen,’ describes the twelve
first maidens of the city forming the dance in front of the
newly-painted nuptial chamber. ‘And they began to sing, I ween, all
beating time to one melody with many-twinkling feet, and the house
was ringing round with a nuptial hymn.’</p>

<p>It was the custom both in Greece and in Italy, when the marriage
procession halted before the bridegroom’s house, to salute it with
a shower of sweetmeats. This recalls the ruder shower of earth that
I saw in Kabylia, and which I took to symbolise a volley of stones.
The custom still survives in Italy; for I have often seen
sweetmeats thrown among the crowd when a newly-married couple have
issued from church; great is the delight and eager the scrambling
of small boys on such occasions.</p>

<h2 class="nopb">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="right less"><em>June</em> 16 <em>to June</em> 24,
1880.</p>

<div class="box-float float-left"><img src='images/decor5.jpg'
class="iwdecor" alt='W'>
</div>

<p class="chstart">E originally proposed to move about the country
with the tent, though we had fixed on no particular limit or
direction to these imaginary travels. But in the middle of the
month of June here were we still in the Aïth Ménguellath, not
fifteen miles from Fort National. We had plenty to occupy us at the
place where we happened to find ourselves, and we reckoned that
moving meant expense and new difficulties with natives, and that we
might go farther and fare worse.</p>

<p>It was now too hot to wander. Muirhead being anxious to go to
Constantine (which I had visited), we now determined to quit our
encampment ‘under the greenwood tree,’ where we had met with ‘no
enemy but winter and rough weather,’ he proceeding thither, whilst
I returned with the tent to Algiers, where we should meet
again.</p>

<p>I had foreseen that in such an out-of-the-way place, where
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> men are so
jealous, I could not hope to get women to sit as models, and
consequently came armed with a camera and gelatine plates. I now
took a number of instantaneous photographs of subjects in motion,
that I could hardly have sketched.</p>

<p>The narrow paths favoured me, for the natives were forced to
pass the very spot I had previously focused, and got caught
‘unbeknown’ to themselves. Whether they happened to group well or
ill at the instant I had to expose, was of course a chance, but if
they did not appear interesting, I postponed my shot. The extreme
damp of the tent caused me much anxiety about the plates, but the
Indian bullock trunk in which I kept them was sturdy, and though
some were spoilt, the majority turned out well. The Kabyles would
ask to look into the machine, and I was always glad to show it, but
first I blocked the light from the lenses, and with much ado spread
the cloth over their heads. All that they then saw was the
landscape at their backs reflected as in a mirror. Having regarded
the lens as a sort of evil eye pointed at them, they were puzzled
when they found that the machine apparently looked out from the
back of its head in the opposite direction. I thought it kind on my
part to show the images the right way up, and they were always much
pleased with the effect.</p>

<p>The moments when figures group together harmoniously are so
fleeting, that at the best there is barely time to note the leading
arrangement. One combination is followed by another, and then
another, and noting each in an imperfect manner, it is impossible
to compare them justly. Photography has quite lately come to such
perfection, that it is now possible with its aid to seize on those
instants of time, and reproduce them with unerring precision;
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> can afterwards
be studied at leisure. Thus the camera can give new and admirable
material for artistic taste and fancy to play upon. I certainly
bagged records of passing combinations with as much certainty as a
sportsman brings down birds.</p>

<p>At dawn on June 16, I bade Muirhead good-bye, and he started for
Constantine. The same day I struck tent, and left for the
neighbouring tribe of the Beni Ienni, where I proposed remaining a
short time. This point was only a few miles away from my direct
line of march.</p>

<p>After some trouble about mules, I started, and an hour’s ride
down a steep path brought me to the foot of the mountain, where I
halted for Dominique who was lagging behind. Here a broad
watercourse of grey stones, with diminutive cliffs on each side,
was overgrown with oleander, a profuse mass of delicate pink bloom.
More beautiful than anything to be found in well-tended gardens,
was this wealth of blossom in a spot so lonely; beloved but by the
sunshine, unvisited but by wandering Zephyr. Nor were the oleanders
alone in their happiness; numberless plants and flowers kept them
company. The pepper-tree grew luxuriantly, and was particularly
beautiful from its fresh and feathery foliage, and the interesting
drawing of its stems. Dominique overtook me, and we proceeded. The
ravine where I found myself joined a larger one, through which
flowed a brisk stream utilised to irrigate adjoining fields.
Besides flowering oleanders were well-cared-for plantations of
oranges and pomegranates, the latter ablaze with exquisite
flame-red blossoms; and vigorous wild vines, rejoicing in the hot
sun, greedy to bear a burden of luscious fruit, half suffocated the
more sober trees forced to support<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_89">[89]</span> them. A plumy carpet of ferns spread about
their feet. The wooded sides of the gorge rose abruptly, and
brilliant light silvered the olives crowning precipitous heights.
These mountain streams that ripple so refreshingly in the summer
season, become boiling torrents in the winter time, after heavy
rains, or when the newly-fallen snows on the Jurjura melt. Suddenly
rising, they cut off all communication between the tribes.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">

<div class="line indent0">So some simple swain his cot

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a hot pull up the mountain, but having got to the top, I
followed a path to the school-house of the Jesuit fathers, where a
very cordial reception awaited me.</p>

<p>I had been told that there was a likely place for camping near
their house. On inspection I found it was shadeless, and so
retraced my steps for about a mile, to a piece of public ground I
had already noticed, where I set to work to pitch the tent. The
situation reminded me of Thililit. This done I called on the Kaïd,
who chatted in French of his experiences during a visit to the
International Exhibition of 1878, and showed me a workshop attached
to his house, where jewellers were busy. On leaving, he sent a
young man to get me fuel, a matter about which I had left Dominique
anxious. On returning to the tent, I found a party of merry
inquisitive schoolboys, whose leader, a bright lad, was the son of
the Kaïd, and spoke French fluently; they accompanied me on a
walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>The following
morning I began a sketch of the village under which I was encamped,
houses peeping picturesquely through foliage. Dominique was in his
worst humour; his wages had been paid before leaving the Aïth
Ménguellath, and having now some notes sewn up in his coat, and
seeing Fort National in the distance, he thought he could do as he
liked. I had to explain that I proposed remaining master. The
upshot was, that flying into a fury, he picked up that wonderful
cardboard box and a cage with a tame blackbird he had amused
himself with rearing, and walked off. I watched his receding back
with feelings of relief, and then pounced on the breakfast which
still simmered on the fire. Afterwards, upon lighting my pipe I
considered my awkward situation; for the tent could not be left a
moment unguarded. About the end of the third pipe, the young man
who had gone for firewood luckily made his appearance; I left the
tent in his charge, and went to see the Kaïd again. Explaining my
case, I added that I should prefer a native to serve me, if a
trustworthy one could be found; he said the Fathers would know of
someone; so, after a cup of coffee, he most politely accompanied me
to the school-house.</p>

<p>The walk was just in the greatest heat of the day, and I began
to fear lest this by no means too solid flesh should thaw entirely
away on the road. The Fathers promised to send for a young man, a
carpenter, formerly a pupil of theirs, who had cooked for them, and
understood French. I supped at the school-house that evening, met
and engaged him, and wrote out an agreement, signed one copy, and
handed Mohammed another to sign. He hesitated; he had forgotten how
to write his name. ‘Well, put a cross,’<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> suggested the Father. He did so; an odd
signature for a Mussulman.</p>

<p>It must always be a pleasure to praise the merits of an old
pupil, but sometimes it is an imprudence, I reflected. However,
Mohammed turned out gentle, obliging, and faithful, and he cooked
sufficiently well for me, though he had not the ideal ‘Potages des
Petits Menus’ of Dominique in his head. He filled up spare time by
nicking a stick of wild-olive all over with ingenious patterns. If
one should believe M. C. Souvestre, who has published a book
entitled ‘Instructions Secrètes des Jésuites,’ it is a sign of
little wisdom to apply to the Society of Jesus for a servant. I
read that a certain worthy Père Valeze Reynald considers that, ‘Les
domestiques peuvent prendre en cachette les biens de leurs maîtres
par forme de compensation, sous prétexte que leurs gages sont trop
modiques, et ils sont dispensés de la restitution.’ With such
professors and a despised ‘cochon d’indigène’ for a pupil, I ought
to have obtained something quite diabolical.</p>

<p>Night began to darken, the moon rose in splendour from behind
the mountains, and a troop of merry boys walked with me along the
narrow path among fields of ripe corn that led to my tent. I found
four guards awaiting me, who rolled themselves up in their
burnouses and passed the night as sentinels. I did not think them
necessary, and the Kaïd told me that he apprehended no danger, but
he was responsible for my safety, and that it was an old custom of
the country, dating from before the French conquest, which he
thought right to keep up. The guards spoke well of their Kaïd, as a
man who kept things up to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_92">[92]</span> mark; in their tribe they did things proper,
not like the Aïth Ménguellath, poor creatures, who go on anyhow.
The Aïth Ménguellath had said to me, ‘Thou forsakest friends to
fall among thieves in the Beni Ienni.’</p>

<p>To enumerate the settlements of the Beni Ienni contained in a
circle within a radius of a mile, will show how thickly inhabited
is Kabylia.</p>

<p>On the precipitous brow nearest to the Fort is Aït el Hassan,
with a population of 1500 souls. A large cemetery, and a rise on
which the Jesuit school-house is built, separate it from Aït
l’Arba, with a population of 900. A little further is Taourirt
Mimoun, a place of equal size. The ridge again descends to the flat
piece of ground where I was. A quarter of a mile off is Taourirt el
Hadjadj, somewhat smaller. Near Taourirt Mimoun, on a southern arm,
is the fifth village, Agouni Hameth; a little below is the sixth,
Thisgirth by name.</p>

<p>The nests of the Kabyles, like those of the eagles, are built on
high in healthy mountain air. They are thus exposed fully to all
the vicissitudes of the circling seasons. They first receive the
white mantle that winter spreads, they first feel the gusty puffs
of coming sirocco, and are earliest enveloped in the chill mist
that the north wind sweeps from the Mediterranean. In the
brightness of spring mornings they sparkle in sunshine, while white
mists cover the profound valleys, like the waters of a lake. Later
on, the sun stirs this sea of cloud, and lets through the day; then
fleecy messengers surround the villages, hastening upwards to sail
in silvery brightness through the sky, bearing afar glad promises
of refreshment and abundance. In summer, when the human
bees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> have stored
their harvest, like honey in a hive, then the little houses seem
clustered together, that each may give kindly shade to its
neighbour, scorched in the burning sunshine.</p>

<p>Thus the people live not estranged from nature, like men in
cities, but from lofty outlooks are constant spectators of the
wonders she works, and the beauty in which she delights.</p>

<p>I found the Kabyles in no way annoyed by my painting and
photography, and as usual they had friendly ways, bringing figs and
sour milk when I was at work, and refusing to be paid for little
services. The camera was unluckily knocked down one day by an eddy
of wind, and the falling shutter broken; a jeweller soldered it
together for me, and refused to accept payment. Another day, a man
brought a good bundle of wood to the tent, and would take no
remuneration; another offered a couple of blackbirds as a
contribution to my ‘pot-au-feu.’</p>

<p>The Kabyles have a reputation for dishonesty, and colonists have
again and again told me, and have most positively insisted that
they were all thieves; but having a limited belief in the fairness
of such warnings, I was always incredulous, and practically found
they deserved a very different character. A solitary instance of
pilfering was all we had to complain of. As we were constantly
surrounded by natives, we might easily have lost more had there
been many ‘mauvais sujets’ about. I cannot say we were not tricked
sometimes; what foreigner is not tricked? But as a rule I take the
Kabyles to be hard bargainers, and afterwards men of their word; on
more than one occasion I have trusted them, when they had every
opportunity to be dishonest, and I have not been deceived. They are
extremely thrifty, and close with their<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94">[94]</span> money, as most men are who have a hard fight
to earn it, and never earn much. I met with a remarkable instance
of honesty when staying in the mountains two years ago. Alone, in
an out-of-way place, sitting down to make a sketch, I unconsciously
dropped my purse. Proceeding perhaps a quarter of a mile, I saw a
Kabyle running in hot haste; he overtook me, breathless, but
evidently amused about something. I felt much taken aback, when
suddenly he handed me my purse. He accepted a present, and I felt
most grateful for his honesty, since, though the purse was a light
one, it contained every sou that I had in the country, and I by no
means regarded it as trash.</p>

<p>On leaving my lodging at Fort National one morning, some faggots
were being bought of a poor Kabyle. The transaction was hardly
concluded, when a Frenchwoman appearing from a shop next door, said
she would take another lot at the same price. The Kabyle replied
that on some former occasion she had tried to cheat him, and he
would have no dealings with her; he quietly turned his back as he
collected his bundles, and then trudged on. She was furious at what
she called his insulting language, and called him all the names she
could think of. It is a small incident to record, but it is
characteristic. Is it credible, for instance, that a Neapolitan
could act thus? He would rather esteem a person who had had the wit
to overreach him, and scheme till he had cheated in return; he
would certainly have been ready with a smooth answer. The story
moreover illustrates the principle, that the more people are sinned
against, the more they get abused.</p>

<p>The Kabyles are abstemious, tough and wiry; an overfat
unwieldy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> Kabyle is
not to be found. Their sobriety, praise be to Mohammed, is
absolute; they drink nothing stronger than coffee. Of course this
does not apply to those who live in towns, where they learn to
tipple, and I believe become more demoralised, if possible, than
the worst class of colonists. It must in honesty be stated, that
they are terribly lacking in that virtue which comes next to
godliness. That they should not appreciate the luxury of soap and
water is the more to be regretted, as it is an inexpensive one.
Some of the shepherd lads who came hoping to earn a few coppers by
carrying our traps, or by the sale of some trifle, when reproached
with uncleanliness, replied, ‘I have not another shirt, nor money
to buy one.’ They pointed out the fragile condition of the one
worn, and expressed fear that the rough usage of washing might
destroy it altogether. Truly such a situation must be embarrassing,
so we said nothing more; nevertheless, clean shirts became less
rare. I am sorry to say that the plague of begging urchins, to be
seen wherever tourists go, has already commenced at Fort National.
I have never been begged of in the tribes. The needy are given
small contributions of food by those who can afford it. Any man,
when eating, would as a matter of course and without hesitating,
offer a portion to a stranger approaching. The Kabyles are
sociable, with unassuming manners. Acquaintances on meeting do not
shake hands, but lightly touch them, then raise their fingers to
their lips, and kiss them;<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> then follows a string of
expressions, such as, Peace be upon thee, mayest thou abound,
good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> be with thee. A
chief is saluted with greater deference; he bows to be kissed in
return above the forehead. Compared with Arabs, Kabyles are
industrious; compared with the English, very lazy. A man will work
hard, but likes to do it at his own time; he does not appreciate
the merit of slaving as hard as he can, when engaged by the day for
others. I have watched them at road-making; as soon as the
inspector’s back was turned, they would sit down for a quiet chat,
or roll themselves up in their cloaks to take a nap, or squat and
complacently watch a neighbour toil with all his force at ploughing
his own land. I have hardly known which to admire more, the
labourer at the plough, or the philosopher with hands folded in
slumber. ‘Labor ipse voluptas’ might be the motto of the one; ‘Sans
gêne’ that of the other.</p>

<p>One remarkable feature of Kabylia is the fertility even of the
high ridges. In the tribe of the Beni Ienni there are fields of
wheat and tobacco on the top of the mountain, both crops requiring
deep soil. The plough is of the simplest description, and is
carried out to the fields on the shoulder of the ploughman, who
drives a couple of active oxen before him. The yoke is very long in
order to give freedom of action to the beasts when turning on
difficult ground.</p>

<p>The Kabyle begins operations by storing grain in his folded
burnous; this he sows broadcast over the land; he next proceeds to
plough in. The oxen scramble up and down, and in and out, among
silvery-stemmed fig-trees; the driver urging them with a long rod,
and with constant exhortations to work properly, such as, ‘Now
forwards; keep higher, higher, mind the fig-tree, turn, now turn,
forwards again, oh sons of infidel ones!’ Sometimes
great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> pains are taken
with a field, it is ploughed twice or thrice, and all weeds
carefully destroyed. Homer describes ploughing:</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">So when two lordly bulls, with equal
toil,</div>

<div class="line indent0">Force the bright ploughshare through the

<div class="line indent0">And trace large furrows with the shining

<div class="line indent0">O’er their huge limbs the foam descends

<div class="line indent0">And streams of sweat down their sour

<p>There is a more detailed account of ploughing in the ‘Works and
Days’ of Hesiod; it is so faithful a picture in all particulars of
what I have seen in Kabylia, that I cannot refrain from quoting a
few sentences. He mentions the arrival of the cranes from Africa as
a sign for commencing work. In Kabylia they remain all the winter
through.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw2">
<figure class="iw2" id="i17"><img src='images/i17.jpg' alt=

</div>

<p>‘Mark too when from on high out of the clouds you shall have
heard the voice of the crane uttering its yearly cry, which
both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> brings the
signal for ploughing and points the season of rainy winter, but
gnaws the heart of the man that hath no oxen. Then truly feed the
crumpled-horned oxen remaining within their stalls; for it is easy
to say the word, “Lend me a yoke of oxen and a wain,” but easy is
it to refuse, saying, “There is work for my oxen.” But when first
the season of ploughing has appeared to mortals, even then rouse
thyself. “Pray to the gods,” that they may load the ripe holy seed
of Demeter, when first beginning thy ploughing, when thou hast
taken in hand the goad at the extremity of the plough-tail, and
touched the back of the oxen dragging the oaken peg of the pole
with the leathern strap. And let the servant boy behind, carrying a
mattock, cause trouble to birds whilst he covers over the seed. For
good management is best to mortal man, and bad management worst.
Thus, if the Olympian god himself afterwards give a prosperous end,
will the ears bend to the ground with fulness; and thou wilt drive
the cobwebs from the bins, and I hope that thou wilt rejoice,
taking for thyself from substance existing within.’</p>

<p>He concludes by pointing out the right seasons, and says that
even a late sower may reap plenteously, if at the first sound of
the cuckoo in mid-spring there be three days’ steady rain.</p>

<p>In Kabylia I have seen ploughing as late as the middle of April,
and followed by much wet, the labour was repaid with a heavy
crop.</p>

<p>‘But if you shall have ploughed late, this would be your remedy:
When the cuckoo sings first on the oak-foliage, and delights
mortals over the boundless earth, then let Jove rain three days,
and not cease, neither overtopping your ox’s hoof-print
nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> falling short of
it; thus would a late plougher be equal with an early one. But duly
observe all things in your mind, nor let either the spring becoming
white with blossoms, or the showers returning at set seasons,
escape your notice.’</p>

<p>In the valleys there are a great many cranes; being unmolested,
they become very tame, and are often seen following the plough; the
ploughman gives no heed as they stand gravely looking on, or
demurely follow his steps.</p>

<p>So the Sicilian reaper sang at work of his love,</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">The wolf follows the she-goat, and the

<p class="nind">suggesting that he followed her furious when she
fled from him, demurely, and in a state of expectancy for favours
to turn up, when she disdainfully suffered his company.</p>

<p>These birds are white, the tips of the wings and tail black, the
bill and legs orange. They fly with a flapping motion, and with
outstretched necks, like wild duck. It is delightful to watch them
settle; they descend with such a grand self-possessed sweep,
suddenly they drop their long yellow legs, and stretch them a
little forwards; at that instant they touch the ground, half a
second later they are poised and calm, as if they had been standing
an hour in meditation. There is sometimes a flock of cranes about a
village, where they build on the gourbis or cane-roofed huts.
Towards evening they sit in their nests, and make a peculiar
rattling noise, by holding the neck back and rapidly clashing the
raised bill:</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Like a crane, or a swallow, so did I
chatter.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>I dined one
evening at the house of Salim, the jeweller of the village of Aït
l’Arba. He showed me beautiful pieces of old jewellery that he
keeps as patterns; and took me to his workshop, where four or five
men were busy. Most of the ornaments which he makes for natives as
well as for officers at the Fort, are of small value; but he is
quite capable of making as handsome pieces as of old, if people
will give the money. A jeweller of Taourirt Mimoun also showed me
large Tafizimen beautifully worked. I never saw such out of the
country.</p>

<p>Now that the natives are less well off than they used to be, it
can be said of them, as it was of another people of old: ‘In that
day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments
about their feet,’ ‘their round tires like the moon, the chains,
and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments
of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the
ear-rings,’ ‘the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles.’</p>

<p>Let us trust that the following verse is not likewise about to
become applicable. ‘And it shall come to pass, that instead of
sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent;
and instead of well-set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a
girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.’ For the pride
of the people is cast down, and their spirit broken, and ‘in that
time shall the present be brought unto the Lord of hosts of a
people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their
beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot.’</p>

<p>The blacksmiths at their forges were busy making cutlery. The
shape of the knives is always pleasing, and they have sometimes
inlaid work. The cheap knives in carved wooden sheaths,
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> are hawked
about Algiers, come from here. In former days, they used also to
manufacture guns with long barrels and highly ornamented stocks.
These forges are tempting warm nooks in the winter time.</p>

<p>The turning of wooden bowls and dishes is another industry. The
piece to be turned is fixed to a chuck revolving backwards and
forwards, instead of continually in one direction, as in our
lathes. The action is given by a thong lapped round the chuck,
attached at one end to a pliable stake fixed in the ground, and at
the other, to a treddle worked by the foot of the turner. The
action is thus of the same nature as that of a drill worked with a
bow.</p>

<p>The women here do not carry their pitchers on their heads, but
on their backs. The vases are pointed at the bottom, just like
ancient amphoræ. The point rests on the girdle, and the jar is thus
steadied, the action of carrying them is not so graceful as the
balancing on the head, which always causes a fine carriage.</p>

<p>The women are the only potters, and these amphoræ are made by
them in the following manner: A store of clay, cleaned, and
properly tempered, is kept at hand in the shade. A rough saucer of
clay is first placed on the ground in a sunny spot. On this a woman
begins to model a vase; starting with the solid pointed end, she
carries the body up a certain height and leaves it. A second is
then begun, and carried to the same point of completion, and so on
till half-a-dozen are growing up. Returning to the first, which
meanwhile has been drying in the sun, she continues to form the
body, bending over, and stepping round and round, with one hand
inside she supports the clay as it is added, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> with the other smoothes,
shapes, and moistens it as required. The sunlight playing on the
wet yellow clay has a pretty effect, and when half formed, the
vases have almost the appearance of strange gigantic crocuses. In
spite of the rudeness of the method, the vases come quickly to
completion, and are wonderfully true in shape. The bodies and the
spouts with curled-over lips finished, she sits on the ground and
models the handles; before the close of day she will have carried
half-a-dozen large amphoræ into the courtyard of her house, where
they are left to dry. As they harden they are rubbed with a smooth
piece of wood, laid in the sun, rubbed again, and so on, till they
look quite polished. When in this state I have seen them glisten to
such a degree that I was under the impression they were waxed. In
this I was mistaken, for the wife of the Amine of Taourirt el
Hadjadj, a good potter, assured me the polish was produced simply
by rubbings as described. The point is interesting, because other
wares are found polished instead of glazed. To complete her work,
the potter again sits down, and holding a vessel paints different
parts with red ochre, and a variety of patterns drawn in black
lines with peroxide of manganese. A number of vases having been
wrought to this state, are put into an open kiln or firepan in the
ground, packed with a quantity of wood, which is ignited, and they
are thus baked. Often a final vegetable varnish is passed over
them.</p>

<p>Lamps are curiously constructed, consisting of two or three rows
of little cups to hold oil one above another; each cup is connected
by a small hole, with an indented projection in front, which serves
to hold the wick. Beneath is a basin to catch the drip, and the
whole is supported on a strong round base.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw2">
<figure class="iw2" id="i18"><img src='images/i18.jpg' alt=

</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>It is singular
that the Kabyles, so proficient in moulding vases, dishes, and
lamps, and in ornamentation, should yet be unacquainted with such a
simple and ancient device as the potter’s wheel. This fact points
in a very significant manner to the isolation in which they have
lived. I have previously described how, in weaving, the woof is
passed through the warp with the fingers instead of with a shuttle,
a curious proof of the same thing. There is a good collection of
Kabyle pottery in the Museum of Native Industries at Algiers,
showing great skill, originality, and fancy in the shapes and in
the patterns drawn on them.</p>

<p>In Commander Cameron’s ‘Across Africa,’ he describes a woman
near Tanganyika Lake making pots, and says that ‘the shapes are
very graceful and wonderfully truly formed, many being like the
amphoræ in the Diomed at Pompeii.’</p>

<p>A vase ending in a point appears at first sight to be an
inconvenient arrangement; but it is well adapted to be carried on
the back, it cannot be left out in the open, where it is most
likely to be exposed to knocks, but must be put away in some
corner, when the peg holds it firm.</p>

<p>The fields were now becoming denuded of their crops, and the
corn was piled in sheaves on the flat ground about the tent. ‘Some
on their part indeed were reaping with sharp sickles the staff-like
stalks laden with ears, as it were a present of Ceres. Others I wot
were binding them in straw ropes, and were laying the threshing
floor.’</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">

<div class="line indent0">While the reaper fills his greedy

<div class="line indent0">And binds the golden sheaves in brittle

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A few days before I left, threshing began. The
preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
surprised me. A party of women brought from the village a large
supply of cow-dung, which they mixed with water and spread out. On
asking why they made that mess, I was told it was to keep the corn
clean. The layer, spread in a large circle, very soon dried hard.
The peas (for they began by threshing peas) were heaped upon it,
and two yoke of oxen driven over them; a man followed each yoke,
and they circled round and round all the afternoon, till the haulm
was broken up, and the peas knocked out.</p>

<p>The night after the arrival of my Kabyle servant, he came
running into the tent while I supped, to tell me that no less than
ten assassins were waiting outside. This news did not upset my
appetite, nor was it so alarming as it sounds; the word assassin
being the Kabyle for guard. It was a curious coincidence to be
sitting surrounded by ‘Assassins,’ while the spurs of the mountain
facing me were inhabited by the Beni Ismael.</p>

<p>In the Lebanon are tribes known as Assassins. It was the name of
a noted fanatical sect of the Ismaelites (one of the
great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> sections into
which Mohammedanism split) formed in the eleventh century in Persia
and Syria. In the latter country their chief stronghold was in the
neighbourhood of Beyrout, and their history is interwoven with the
Crusades.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> Owing to the objectionable methods by which they
sought to increase their power, their name was carried by the
Crusaders into Europe, and in several modern languages has become a
term expressive of cool premeditated murder. The origin of the word
has been discussed by the learned, and M. Sylvestre de Sacy
narrates a curious story of Marco Polo’s, which has induced him to
derive the word from ‘Hashishin.’ This is the Arabic for ‘herbs;’
and he endeavours to prove that the Ismaelites, who committed so
many crimes, were great smokers of Hashish, a well-known
intoxicating preparation of hemp leaves. I leave the etymology of
the word to others, but confess that the theories proposed appear
quite fanciful. Moreover the word is far older than the date
assigned to it by M. Sylvestre de Sacy; for it occurs in the Bible
in reference to a disturbance in the Holy Land. When St. Paul was
arrested in Jerusalem, on addressing himself to the Roman tribune,
the latter exclaimed, ‘Dost thou know Greek? Art thou not then the
Egyptian which before these days stirred up to sedition and led out
into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?’<a id=
"FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Who
then were these people? Were they native troops serving under the
Romans, and recruited from hill tribes, answering to our Sepoys, or
to the French Turcos?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>The assassins
came regularly, the different villages having been ordered to
supply them in rotation, but usually they were only four or five in
number. I supplied them with coffee and tobacco, and as they sat
round the flickering camp-fire they amused themselves with singing
songs which I liked to hear; a succession of plaintive cadences. My
impression is, that they were all love-sick assassins, plaintively
lamenting to the jealous moon the enforced absence from their
loves. Glorious balmy nights they were; the moon shone with
splendour, the fields of ripened barley sloped to a mysterious
abyss, beyond rose-dim peaks.</p>

<p>There are professional minstrels in Kabylia who repeat songs,
tales, and sayings handed down by tradition, and who also invent
new ones. They wander about the country after the harvests of corn,
figs, and olives, and are paid not in money, but in kind. In some
tribes the minstrel receives an annual gift, which can be
considered as a pension provided from the communal purse. Some who
have the gift of invention stop at home, but their compositions are
sung through the country, nevertheless; for itinerant minstrels
come from afar to learn, and thus make additions to their stock.
The musician warbles running cadences on a reed-pipe, sings a
verse, and warbles on the pipe again; he will thus continue tuneful
for a whole afternoon, halting occasionally to chat a while with
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> audience. A
number of such songs have been collected by General A. Hanoteau.
Many refer to engagements with the French at the time of the
conquest, others are of a more general character. I translate a few
as samples.</p>

<p>The first verse of the following song is a picture of war; the
second, of stormy weather. These introduce the motive of the third;
ordinary means of communication being interrupted, a lover entreats
a bird to carry a message to his mistress. In the verses that
follow, he gives an account of how he fell into his present love
sick condition, and represents the lady as returning his affection.
It will be remarked that in these latter verses there is an echo of
the two that are introductory. A picture is given of domestic
insubordination to legitimate authority, and attachment to the free
lover; the path of true love is beset with uncertainty and storms,
the road to domestic happiness is blocked. The Kabyle law must be
kept in mind, that a man can, when he wishes, repudiate his wife,
and that she cannot marry again without he approves of the new
aspirant to her hand.</p>

</p>

<p class="less">An old man had seven sons. His wife died, and he
remained a widower. One day his sons were seated and talking. The
youngest of them said to his brothers, ‘Come, O my brothers! let us
sell some goats, and with the price of them marry our father
again.’ They dropped this subject of conversation, and passed on to
another.</p>

<p class="less">The old man said to them, ‘Let us return to the
conversation about the goats.’</p>

<p class="space-above15">The weather grew very hot, though not
oppressive, for a fresh breeze sprang up in the middle of the day,
and blew till four or five o’clock, a blast most grateful to
perspiring mortals, but sometimes accompanied with eddies of wind,
which the natives called thaboushithant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>The children,
when they saw an eddy approach, would leave off their play of
building villages, that is, piling stones into little heaps, with
bits of stick placed upright atop to represent mosque towers, and

twisted, flying about their heads, would wrap them in confusion.
Thus do the children indulge in the building of imagined houses,
vain castle-building, for</p>

</div>

<p>In spite of this grateful breeze, I was glad to keep quiet in
the middle of the day. How impressive is the hour of noon in the
south! When the sun rides in triumphant power overhead, and showers
his fervid rays upon the earth, and the sky has lost its deep blue,
and is of a palpitating grey, towards the horizon quite warm and
glowing; when the trees twinkle with innumerable stars of light,
and distant rocky crags glitter through the purple bloom of
distance; when cattle seek the shade, and the harvester puts aside
his sickle, for ‘reapers ought to begin at the rising of the
crested lark, and to cease when it goes to rest; but to keep
holiday during the heat.’ Insect life alone is quickened, and the
air is all athrob with heat, and the loud incessant songs of the
cicala.</p>

<p>Then it is that the mountains are most beautiful, though there
is a fascination about them under all aspects, and whatever their
mood.</p>

<p>At dawn; when the light of the rising sun touching them, breaks
their massed shadows with a joyous greeting.</p>

<p>In the evening; when they blush and glow at his
departure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> Through
the fresh clearness of a spring day; when robed in blue, they look
majestically serene.</p>

<p>In a spring morning; when they are half veiled by rising mists
which by-and-by will be gently driven in flocks of clouds across
the azure meads of heaven.</p>

<p>During the calm mellow afternoon; when the contented land basks
in sunshine at their feet, and their summits are capped with
fantastic battlements of cloud.</p>

<p>During the ominous lull preceding a sirocco, the air thick and
yellow, when they become mysterious and ghostly, hooded with pallid
white.</p>

<p>In the thunderstorm, when they are of deepest purple, to be
engulfed in the black clouds, from which dart forked lightnings;
for offended Jove</p>

<div class="line indent0">By fits he deals his fiery bolts
about.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes I have stood on a height in the tumult of a storm, in
the whirl of driving mists, when a rent was suddenly torn in the
black canopy, and for an instant, the lofty crags were seen
glistening against the deep sky, calm, like sustaining hope in the
time of trouble. Sometimes, rejoicing in the freshness of a
glorious winter’s morning, I have fancied, that upon their lustrous
summits is spread a carpet for the immortals, for</p>

<div class="line indent0">Than what more humble mountains offer
here,</div>

<div class="line indent0">Where, in their blessings, all those Gods
appear.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At noon, while ‘the tuneful cicala, perched on a tree,
poured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> forth a
shrill song from under his wings,’ I used to spread a cloth in the
shade, and ‘with face turned to catch the brisk-blowing Zephyr,’
reclined there rejoicing. Mohammed sat by my side, and devised new
patterns to be carved upon my stick of wild olive. My neighbour of
the threshing-floor, with a wreath of pea wound round his head, the
curling tendrils falling on his shoulders, squatted hard by,
contemplating the heaped-up corn, whilst he pictured capacious bins
overflowing with a bountiful store.</p>

<p>The pipe in my mouth was not a melodious one, but there rose
from it a fragrant cloud—as I may say—an incense, grateful I trust,
to her who has ever been honoured in these regions; ‘the mountain
nymph, sweet Liberty.’</p>

<p>In these uplands during the noontide lull, or at tranquil
evening, does she not revisit her haunts, and bless the careworn
husbandman?</p>

<p>But the time had arrived to retreat from sylvan bowers and
return to the more civilised homes of men.</p>

<p>On June 24 I struck the tent; while the shades of night yet
slumbered upon the mountains, and the people began descending to
renew their labours. ‘Make you haste; gather and bring home your
corn, rising at the dawn, that you may have substance sufficient.
For the morning obtains by lot a third share of the day’s work. The
morn, look you, furthers a man on his road, and furthers him too in
his work; the morn, I say, which at its appearing sets many men on
their road, and places the yoke on many oxen.’</p>

effects packed on mules, I sent off Mohammed with them to Tizi
Ouzou, starting myself for the Fort, where I had matters to
arrange.</p>

<p>I had never before seen the place in its summer dress, and was
surprised at the transformation; for its ugly little houses were
half hidden in verdure, and the acacias lining the road were of an
astonishingly rich green.</p>

<p>At the inn I learned that Dominique had remained two or three
days, making such amends as he could for his long abstinence from
liquor. There also I met some of the Fathers, with whom I dined;
and having done my business, and bid good-bye to Madame Pierre, who
had in many ways been most attentive, I took omnibus to Tizi
Ouzou.</p>

<p>I found my luggage in a pile, and faithful Mohammed sitting on
the top keeping guard. We parted on the best of terms.</p>

<p>The following morning I arrived at Algiers. Muirhead, who had
already returned from his trip to Constantine, tried to induce me
to return by sea; but I was proof against the attractions of the
swell in the Bay of Biscay, and instead, took the overland journey
by Marseilles.</p>

<p>A few days later, I was back in the Great City, where the sun
cares not much to show his face, and the heavens seem to be ever
weeping over the sins of the people.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class=
"label">[1]</span></a>I am not aware whether anyone has previously
remarked that the Kabyles click. In a paper published by the
Society of Arts, March 4, 1881, on the Languages of Africa, by
Robert N. Cust, I was amused to learn that clicking is common to
many languages. Speaking of the Hottentots, Mr. Cust says: ‘The
great feature of the language is the existence of four clicks,
formed by a different position of the tongue; the dental click is
almost identical with the sound of indignation, not unfrequently
uttered by Europeans; the lateral click is the sound with which
horses are stimulated to action; the guttural click is not unlike
the popping of a champagne cork; and the palatal click is compared
to the cracking of a whip.’ He says that the Bushman, in addition
to the four clicks of the Hottentot language, has a fifth, sixth,
and sometimes a seventh and eighth. According to Bleek and Lepsius,
two authorities, Hottentot is, curiously, entirely distinct from
other languages spoken by black races, and is connected with the
Hamitic languages of white races of North Africa.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class=
"label">[2]</span></a>According to Baron H. Aucapitaine the
Jubaleni are the moderns Igáouáouen concerning whom a neighbouring
tribe sings as follows:—</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">‘O God, give us snow! May the sky be full

<div class="line indent0">That the accursed pass may be

<div class="line indent0">Their friendship is a grief,</div>

<div class="line indent0">Their acquaintance a path with a steep
declivity.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jubaleni at first recalls the Arabic ‘Jibel’ (a mountain). The
Arabs however did not appear in the country till many centuries
later, and the word Jubaleni has a very ancient and interesting
origin. Iolaus, Jolaus, or Jubal was worshipped by the Phœnicians
as a god. ‘Without doubt he is the Juba or Jubal also worshipped by
the Moors. It again occurs in the name of the Mauretanian King
Juba, and in the African Jubaltiana. Thus also Iolaus has been
retained in the name of the town Iol or Jol.’ The word also occurs
as an attribute of the god Baal ‘Ju-Baal’ (the glory of the Lord.)
(See Mövers, <em>Die Phönizier</em>.) Upon the city of Iol was
built the Roman town of Cæsarea, the remains of which are to be
seen at Cherchel. According to Mövers, Baal became the national god
of the Mauretanians.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class=
"label">[4]</span></a>Since writing the above, the French have
entered Tunis, and at the point of the bayonet, have forced the Bey
to sign a treaty. In future there is to be progress, and we have
the gratification of learning that already civilisation is
advancing in its normal manner. In the ‘Daily News’ of June 7, was
a letter from the correspondent in the French camp, dated May 26,
1881, in which he gives an interesting account of the introduction
of the old Algerian institution of razzia into Tunis, which he thus
graphically describes. ‘It is simple in its aim, simple in its
execution. It requires but one condition: You must be stronger than
the enemy or friend towards whom the razzia is directed. The
receipt is: Take a sufficiently strong force, scour the country of
the enemy or friend, drive off all his cattle, if necessary spoil
his crops, burn his tents, and if it is possible to perform a good
clean sweeping razzia without shooting anybody, do not do so.’
‘Depreciation of property is of course the effect of a razzia. The
French find themselves with more cattle than they know what to do
with, and sell them to the highest bidder. I have had pointed out
to me a Frenchman whose business it is to go from one camp to
another picking up cattle cheap. The effect on the Arabs themselves
is, they will sell everything they have for what it will fetch,
feeling that at any moment it may be taken from them.’</p>

<p>The letter continues, ‘I have always made it my business to
inquire about the Kroumirs. Here, as elsewhere, I find the same
story. Few people have ever seen one.’ ‘So certain is every one
that no further fighting can possibly occur, and that any attempt
to find the Kroumirs is abandoned, that I leave for Tunis
to-morrow, marvelling much at a campaign that has had no beginning,
no middle, no ending, and that has taken 40,000 troops away from
their homes to invade the country of an enemy who has been
invisible.’ The Kroumirs (if they really exist) are Berbers, and
there is no reason to believe that they are worse people than those
I have described living amongst. Owing to some unknown mental
process, the French colonist believes that ingratitude is a
fundamental defect in the native character; and concludes that, on
account of this ineradicable moral cancer, he is not beloved and
respected as he ought to be.</p>

‘an habitual loafer.’ ‘First of all get a house, and a woman, and a
ploughing ox. A woman purchased, not wedded.’ I read that Aristotle
evidently believes that wife is here understood, and hence some
think that the second line is spurious. Does not the difficulty
arise from looking at it from a modern European standpoint? The
whole passage is perfectly applicable to Kabyle society. More
advice follows: ‘Most of all marry her who lives near you, when you
have duly looked round on everything, lest you should marry a
cause-of-mocking for your neighbours.’ I conclude that the advice
of the song not to marry in one’s village, is in order to avoid
bickerings and interference from relatives, leading to loss of
dignity, like shaving off the beard. Better to be on the safe side,
and seek for a girl unknown to the neighbourhood, who, separated
from friends, will not bring upon you causes for mocking.</p>
